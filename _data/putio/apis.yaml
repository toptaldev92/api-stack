  description: Put.io, launched in 2009, is a cloud storage service with a BitTorrent
    engine that downloads and puts torrents into the users&rsquo; private online space.
    After purchasing a paid membership account, users are able to keep redundant copies
    of their files which can be accessed from anywhere with a browser. They can be accessed
    automatically from BitTorrent networks, FTPs, direct download links, RapidShare
    links, or basic HTTP authenticated links. The downloaded files are then streamed
    via a suitable player on a PC or smart TV. Torrent movies can be streamed this way,
    too. Users can store videos of their families, activities and work, and access them
    from where ever they want and whenever they choose
