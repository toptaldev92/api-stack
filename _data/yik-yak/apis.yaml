- "{\n\t\"name\": \"Yik Yak\",\n\t\"description\": \"Yik Yak is a social media smartphone
    application. It is available for iOS and Android and it allows people pseudo-anonymously
    to create and view discussion threads within a 5-mile radius (termed Yaks by the
    application). It is similar to other anonymous sharing apps such as Nearby, but
    differs from others such as Whisper in that it is intended for sharing primarily
    with those in proximity to the user, potentially making it more intimate and relevant
    for people reading the posts. All users have the ability to contribute to the stream
    by writing, responding, and voting up or voting down (liking or disliking) yaks.\",\n\t\"image\":
