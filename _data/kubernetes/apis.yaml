  description: Manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system to accelerate
    Dev and simplify Ops. Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker
    containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages
    workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using
    the concepts of labels and pods, it groups the containers which make up an application
    into logical units for easy management and discovery.
