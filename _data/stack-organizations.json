Using open standards ensures interoperability among different software products made by different manufacturers. These principles mean that users can implement custom solutions without having any knowledge of the service providers. This facilitates just-in-time integration and allows users to implement new ideas easily and dynamically. Most of the EASIN web services use the RESTful approach and return requested data as XML.
