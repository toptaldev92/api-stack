- name: Environmental Protection Agency
  description: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or sometimes USEPA)
    is an agency of the U.S. federal government which was created for the purpose of
    protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations
    based on laws passed by Congress. The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon
    and began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order.
    The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and
    Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the president
    and approved by Congress. The current administrator is Gina McCarthy. The EPA is
    not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.
