- "{\n\t\"name\": \"Environmental Protection Agency\",\n\t\"description\": \"The
    United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or sometimes USEPA) is an agency
    of the U.S. federal government which was created for the purpose of protecting human
    health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed
    by Congress. The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon and began operation
    on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing
    the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is
    led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by Congress.
    The current administrator is Gina McCarthy. The EPA is not a Cabinet department,
    but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.\",\n\t\"image\": \"http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/280px-Environmental_Protection_Agency_logo.svg.png\",\n\t\"x-open-ranking\":
