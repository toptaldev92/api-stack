  description: Instagram is an online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing and social
    networking service that enables its users to take pictures and videos, and share
    them on a variety of social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr
    and Flickr. A distinctive feature is that it confines photos to a square shape,
    similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio
    typically used by mobile device cameras. Users can also apply digital filters to
    their images. The maximum duration for Instagram videos is 15 seconds.
