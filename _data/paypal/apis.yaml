  - name: PayPal Permissions
    description: |-
      The popular online payment giant PayPal provides a variety of API&#039;s that allow users to customize and automate how they interact with PayPal&#039;s system and customers. However, because of access and permissions issues, these API&#039;s can be limited in situations where those who are using the API are not the account owner.
  
      The PayPal Permissions API provides additional flexibility for PayPal users, allowing them to request and manage permissions for specific users to execute PayPal API operations on their behalf. These permissions provide a signature that a third party can use as authorization for PayPal API operations, and ensures that these actions can be distinguished from those of the actual account holder.
