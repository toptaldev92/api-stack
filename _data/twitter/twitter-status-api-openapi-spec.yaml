          by the authenticating user and the users they follow. The home timeline is
          central to how most users interact with the Twitter service.Up to 800 Tweets
          are obtainable on the home timeline. It is more volatile for users that follow
          many users or follow users who tweet frequently.See Working with Timelines
          for instructions on traversing timelines efficiently.

          is especially useful to get the details (hydrate) a collection of Tweet IDs.GET
          statuses / show / :id is used to retrieve a single tweet object.There are
          a few things to note when using this method.You must be following a protected
          user to be able to see their most recent tweets. If you don&#8217;t follow
          a protected user their status will be removed.The order of tweet IDs may not
          match the order of tweets in the returned array.If a requested tweet is unknown
          or deleted, then that tweet will not be returned in the results list, unless
          the map parameter is set to true, in which case it will be returned with a
          value of null.If none of your lookup criteria matches valid tweet IDs an empty
          array will be returned for map=false.You are strongly encouraged to use a
          POST for larger requests.

          of the one seen when you view your mentions on twitter.com.This method can

          be automatically recognized as an Embedded Tweet when Twitter&#8217;s widget
          JavaScript is included on the page.The oEmbed endpoint allows customization
          of the final appearance of an Embedded Tweet by setting the corresponding
          properties in HTML markup to be interpreted by Twitter&#8217;s JavaScript
          bundled with the HTML response by default. The format of the returned markup
          may change over time as Twitter adds new features or adjusts its Tweet representation.The
          Tweet fallback markup is meant to be cached on your servers for up to the
          suggested cache lifetime specified in the cache_age.The oEmbed endpoint supports
          unauthenticated requests at api.twitter.com/1/statuses/oembed.{format} suitable
          for distributed software and general discovery. Individual sites should request
          oEmbed data using an application token.

          if the user has used the Geotagging API to send a statuses/update.The JSON

          that Twitter renders are reversed from the GeoJSON specification (GeoJSON
          specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas we are currently representing
          it as a latitude then a longitude). Our JSON renders as: geo: { type:Point,
          coordinates:[37.78029, -122.39697] }ContributorsIf there are no contributors

          account &#8212; this is a beta feature that is not yet generally available

          to this status (an example of a status that has been contributed to is this
          one). In practice, there is usually only one ID in this array. The JSON renders

        summary: statuses/update
        description: 'Updates the authenticating user&#8217;s current status, also known
          as tweeting.For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the
          authenticating user&#8217;s recent tweets. Any attempt that would result in
          duplication will be blocked, resulting in a 403 error. Therefore, a user cannot
          submit the same status twice in a row.While not rate limited by the API a
          user is limited in the number of tweets they can create at a time. If the
          number of updates posted by the user reaches the current allowed limit this
          method will return an HTTP 403 error.About GeoAny geo-tagging parameters in
          the update will be ignored if geo_enabled for the user is false (this is the
          default setting for all users unless the user has enabled geolocation in their
          settings)The number of digits passed the decimal separator passed to lat,
          up to 8, will be tracked so that the lat is returned in a status object it
          will have the same number of digits after the decimal separator.Please make
          sure to use to use a decimal point as the separator (and not the decimal comma)
          for the latitude and the longitude - usage of the decimal comma will cause
          the geo-tagged portion of the status update to be dropped.For JSON, the response
          mostly uses conventions described in GeoJSON. Unfortunately, the geo object
          has coordinates that Twitter renderers are reversed from the GeoJSON specification
          (GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas we are currently representing
          it as a latitude then a longitude. Our JSON renders as: geo: { type:Point,
          coordinates:[37.78217, -122.40062] }The coordinates object is replacing the
          geo object (no deprecation date has been set for the geo object yet) &#8212;
          the difference is that the coordinates object, in JSON, is now rendered correctly
          in GeoJSON.If a place_id is passed into the status update, then that place
          will be attached to the status. If no place_id was explicitly provided, but
          latitude and longitude are, we attempt to implicitly provide a place by calling
          geo/reverse_geocode.Users will have the ability, from their settings page,
          to remove all the geotags from all their tweets en masse. Currently we are
          not doing any automatic scrubbing nor providing a method to remove geotags
          from individual tweets.'

          it creates a Tweet with a picture attached.Unlike POST statuses/update, this

          Media for a guide to using this method.The Tweet text will be rewritten to

          Use of SSL is required with this method.Important: In API v1.1, you now use
          api.twitter.com as the domain instead of upload.twitter.com.Users are limited
          to a specific daily media upload limit.. Requests to this endpoint will return

          media upload limits:X-MediaRateLimit-Limit - Indicates the total pieces of
          media the current user may upload before the time indicated in X-MediaRateLimit-Reset.X-MediaRateLimit-Remaining

          value in X-MediaRateLimit-Limit and the user can resume uploading media.If
          the user is over the daily media limit, this method will return an HTTP 403
          error. In addition to media upload limits, the user is still limited in the
          number of statuses they can publish daily. If the user tries to exceed the
          number of updates allowed, this method will also return an HTTP 403 error,
          similar to POST statuses / update.OAuth is handled differently for POST messages.
          See Uploading Media for more details on this.Example RequestNote: The OAuth

          most recent Tweets. Native retweets of other statuses by the user is included
          in this total, regardless of whether include_rts is set to false when requesting
          this resource.See Working with Timelines for instructions on traversing timelines.See
          Embeddable Timelines, Embeddable Tweets, and GET statuses/oembed for tools
