      The service supplements the provider&#039;s CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing services to scale virtual server resources up and down in response to traffic, resource scheduling, and system performance status. It automatically launches or terminates instances in the provider&#039;s cloud platform for flexible response to system conditions either detected or preset.
  
      API methods support definition of resource groupings and assignment of processing capacity according to policies set beforehand matching system responses to conditions detected. Methods also support gathering and processing of system performance metrics and definition of system response policies based on those metrics. The API allows for notifications based on defined system events and conditions.

    description: Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly
      scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers.
      By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed components
      of their applications that perform different tasks, without losing messages or
      requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build
      an automated workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute
      Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.
