  description: Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship,
    and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight
    runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications
    and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components
    and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments.
    As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data
    center VMs, and any cloud.
