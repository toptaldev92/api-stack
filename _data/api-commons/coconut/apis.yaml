description: We let developers spend their time on their application code, not building
  a brand new encoding system from scratch. Formerly HeyWatch and founded in 2006,
  Coconut is a cloud-based video encoding platform that lets developers move video
  encoding to the cloud with just a few lines of code. We know that developers spend
  a lot of time on their application code, so we want to make things easier and more
  productive for them offering beautiful code, API and documentation.
