description: Transparency Toolkit uses open data to watch the watchers and hold the
  powerful to account. We build free software to collect and analyze open data from
  a variety of sources. Then we work with investigative journalists and human rights
  organizations to turn that into useful, actionable knowledge. Currently, our primary
  focuses are investigating surveillance and human rights abuses.
