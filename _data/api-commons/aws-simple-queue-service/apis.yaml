description: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully
  managed message queuing service. Amazon SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to
  decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use Amazon SQS to transmit
  any volume of data, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always
  available. Amazon SQS includesu0026nbsp;standard queuesu0026nbsp;with high throughput
  and at-least-once processing, andu0026nbsp;FIFO queuesu0026nbsp;that provide FIFO
  (first-in, first-out) delivery and exactly-once processing. u0026nbsp;nWith Amazon
  SQS, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly
  available messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.
