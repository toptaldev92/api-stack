description: The Azure Relay service facilitates hybrid applications by enabling you
  to securely expose services that reside within a corporate enterprise network to
  the public cloud, without having to open a firewall connection, or require intrusive
  changes to a corporate network infrastructure. Relay supports a variety of different
  transport protocols and web services standards.
