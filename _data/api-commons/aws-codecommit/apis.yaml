name: AWS CodeCommit
description: AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that makes it
  easy for companies to host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories.
  CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry
  about scaling its infrastructure. You can use CodeCommit to securely store anything
  from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.
