name: A View From My Seat
description: Our goal is to bring sports fans photos from every seat in every sports
  venue. We want you to know what the view is while buying tickets and before going
  to the game. Never get stuck behind a foul pole or end up with an obstruction. Find
  the seat with the perfect view.
