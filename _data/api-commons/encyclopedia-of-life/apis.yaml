name: Encyclopedia of Life
description: Encyclopedia of Life was founded with the vision of providing an online
  resource with a webpage of information for every known species on the planet. Our
  knowledge of the many life-forms on Earth - of animals, plants, fungi, protists
  and bacteria - is scattered around the world in books, journals, databases, websites,
  specimen collections, and in the minds of people everywhere. Imagine what it would
  mean if this information could be gathered together and made available to everyone
  u2013 anywhere u2013 at a moment's notice.
