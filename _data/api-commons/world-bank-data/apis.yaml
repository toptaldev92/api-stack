description: The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance
  to developing countries around the world. We are not a bank in the common sense.
  We are made up of two unique development institutions owned by 185 member countriesu0026acirc;u0026euro;u0026rdquo;the
  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International
  Development Association (IDA). u0026nbsp;Each institution plays a different but
  collaborative role to advance the vision of an inclusive and sustainable globalization.
  The IBRD focuses on middle income and creditworthy poor countries, while IDA focuses
  on the poorest countries in the world. Together we provide low-interest loans, interest-free
  credits and grants to developing countries for a wide array of purposes that include
  investments in education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial
  and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource
  management.
