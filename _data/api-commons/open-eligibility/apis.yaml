name: Open Eligibility
description: The Open Eligibility Project is a collaborative for a better human service
  taxonomy. The taxonomy is a simple way to categorize human services and human situations.
  With these common categories, we, as service providers, navigators, and people in
  need, can find human services quickly and easily. This is an API setup and operated
  by API Evangelist to support the evolution of the specification, and use across
  many different human services API projects.
