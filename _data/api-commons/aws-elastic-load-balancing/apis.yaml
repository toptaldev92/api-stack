description: Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application
  traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve fault tolerance
  in your applications, seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing
  capacity needed to route application traffic.nElastic Load Balancing offers two
  types of load balancers that both feature high availability, automatic scaling,
  and robust security. These include theu0026nbsp;Classic Load Balanceru0026nbsp;that
  routes traffic based on either application or network level information, and theu0026nbsp;Application
  Load Balanceru0026nbsp;that routes traffic based on advanced application level information
  that includes the content of the request. The Classic Load Balancer is ideal for
  simple load balancing of traffic across multiple EC2 instances, while the Application
  Load Balancer is ideal for applications needing advanced routing capabilities, microservices,
  and container-based architectures. Application Load Balancer offers ability to route
  traffic to multiple services or load balance across multiple ports on the same EC2
  instance.
