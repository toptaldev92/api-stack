name: OpenVZ Containers
description: OpenVZ is container-based virtualization for Linux. OpenVZ creates multiple
  secure, isolated Linux containers (otherwise known as VEs or VPSs) on a single physical
  server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not
  conflict. Each container performs and executes exactly like a stand-alone server;
  a container can be rebooted independently and have root access, users, IP addresses,
  memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries and configuration files.u0026nbsp;
