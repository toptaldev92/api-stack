description: 'Distimo has a very clear objective: to make the app market transparent.
  u0026nbsp;The company was born out of the frustration of a lack of insights into
  the performance of apps and the manual work needed to track important metrics. Our
  goal is to provide the best and most actionable app intelligence for anyone who
  wants to compete in the app market. Our data-driven team seeks to help developers,
  brands and financial services companies gain actionable, timely and factual knowledge
  of whatu0026rsquo;s happening daily in the global app market.'
