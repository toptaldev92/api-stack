description: 'Distimo has a very clear objective: to make the app market transparent.
  nbsp;The company was born out of the frustration of a lack of insights into the
  performance of apps and the manual work needed to track important metrics. Our goal
  is to provide the best and most actionable app intelligence for anyone who wants
  to compete in the app market. Our data-driven team seeks to help developers, brands
  and financial services companies gain actionable, timely and factual knowledge of
  whatrsquo;s happening daily in the global app market.'
