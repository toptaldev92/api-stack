name: API Stylebook
description: A Github hosted, aggregate set of API design topics. The API Stylebook
  has brought together the API design style guides of leading API providers and merged
  them into a single source of API design principles. It is hosted on Github, with
  the data behind available as YAML, making it easily forkable, and replicable for
  any API provider looking to establish their own API design guide.
