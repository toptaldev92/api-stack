  researchers, activists, and regular citizens to request, analyze u0026amp; share
  government documents, making politics more transparent and democracies more informed.
  The site provides a repository of hundreds of thousands of pages of original government
  materials, information on how to file requests, and tools to make the requesting
  process easier. In addition, MuckRock staff and outside contributors do original
  reporting and analysis of many of the documents received through the site. MuckRocks
  unique form of investigative and accountability journalism has been recognized by
  the Sunlight Foundation, The Freedom of the Press Foundation, and hundreds of local
  and national news outlets for its groundbreaking work in areas such as government
  spending, surveillance, and public safety.
