  title: TelAPI
  description: TelAPI is a REST API. What that means for you is that interacting with
    TelAPI to perform all of your telephony needs is almost as simple as visiting
    a website. Deeper knowledge regarding REST is useful when developing with TelAPI
    but definitely not required. We aim to provide all of the information needed for
    working with our REST API throughout its documentation provided here, so even
    if you are new to REST, TelAPI will still be a pleasure to use.
