description: CloudMine automates back-end development for mobile developers so they
  have more time to focus on making their apps shine. In the mobile world, developers
  need to focus on front end (what the user sees on their phone) and back end (what
  makes the app work). CloudMine lowers the barrier to entry for mobile development
  for independent developers, small shops, and enterprises. The CloudMine toolkit
  acts as a gateway to our backend solution. CloudMine stores appsu0026rsquo; data,
  maintains their servers, and scales themas needed. This allows developers to build
  and ship apps faster and with lower risk. Specifically, many apps need to use the
  internet to communicate or store data. We eliminate these pain points. CloudMine
  handles the majority of backend work, so that mobile developers donu0026rsquo;t
  have to.
