name: White House
description: Whitehouse.gov is the official website of the White House and is owned
  by the United States government. Launched in October 1994,[3] it contains general
  American history information, as well as current news pertaining to the President,
  press briefings, proclamations, executive orders, and any speeches the president
  has made on the radio. The website is the responsibility of the incumbent administration.
  As a result the site is completely redesigned for each new president, and the sites
  structure and URLs are often inconsistent from one administration to the next.
