description: Data feeds are used for distributing data across the internet in a machine
  readable format. The City uses the Open Data Protocol (OData) to make public datasets
  available as queryable data feeds. Any software that understands OData feeds can
  be used to browse the data. One way you will be able to quickly begin interacting
  with the Cityu2019s public data feeds is with Microsoft Excel and the PowerPivot
  plugin.
