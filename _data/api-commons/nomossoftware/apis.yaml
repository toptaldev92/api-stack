description: 'Onboarding new customers, and rolling out new services and products
  to existing customers, often involves integrating the customers IT systems via the
  organisations APIs and XML channels. Customer portals from Nomos make this process
  smoother by providing an interactive means for customers to understand and uncover
  the business policies that they must comply with. The portals are also used to troubleshoot
  problems when automated requests from customers fail. '
