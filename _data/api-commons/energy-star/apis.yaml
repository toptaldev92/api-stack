description: EPAs Automated Benchmarking System (ABS) is a free web service designed
  to exchange energy use data and facility information, with EPAs Portfolio Manager
  software tool. Using XML-based Web Services provided by the EPA, third-party energy
  service companies can securely provide energy and building data from their systems
  to Portfolio Manager in exchange for receiving the EPAs energy performance rating
  and other related energy and environmental performance metrics. The documents and
  applications described below help you assess the technical knowledge necessary to
  use ABS to provide your customers with the 1 to 100 energy performance ratings.
