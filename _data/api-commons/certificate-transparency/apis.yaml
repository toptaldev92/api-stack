name: Certificate Transparency
description: Googles Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural flaws
  in the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic system that underlies
  all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the reliability and effectiveness of encrypted
  Internet connections and can compromise critical TLS/SSL mechanisms, including domain
  validation, end-to-end encryption, and the chains of trust set up by certificate
  authorities. If left unchecked, these flaws can facilitate a wide range of security
  attacks, such as website spoofing, server impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
