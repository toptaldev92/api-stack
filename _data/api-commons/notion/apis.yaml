description: Notionu0026rsquo;s single sensor makes it easy to monitor your entire
  home, no matter where you are. No one cares about your home as much as you do.But,
  wed like to think were a close second. We created Notion because, like you, we want
  to know with certainty that everything is ok in our homes, or know immediately when
  things are not as they should be. We live in a connected world, and we believe thereu0026rsquo;s
  no reason we shouldnu0026rsquo;t be able to know when important things happen in
  our homes.
