description: Neo4j is an open-source graph database, implemented in Java. The developers
  describe Neo4j as embedded, disk-based, fully transactional Java persistence engine
  that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables. Neo4j is the most popular
  graph database. Neo4j version 1.0 was released in February, 2010. The community
  edition of the database is licensed under the free GNU General Public License (GPL)
  v3. The additional modules, such as online backup and high availability, are licensed
  under the free Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3. The database, with the additional
  modules, is also available under a commercial license, in a dual license model.
