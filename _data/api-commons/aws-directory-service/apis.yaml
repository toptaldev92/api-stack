description: AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Enterprise Edition),
  also known as AWS Microsoft AD, enables your directory-aware workloads and AWS resources
  to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. The Microsoft AD service is built
  on actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you to synchronize or
  replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud. You can use standard
  Active Directory administration tools and take advantage of built-in Active Directory
  features such as Group Policy, trusts, and single sign-on. With Microsoft AD, you
  can easily joinu0026nbsp;Amazon EC2u0026nbsp;andu0026nbsp;Amazon RDS for SQL Serveru0026nbsp;instances
  to a domain, and useu0026nbsp;AWS Enterprise IT applicationsu0026nbsp;such asu0026nbsp;Amazon
  WorkSpacesu0026nbsp;with Active Directory users and groups.
