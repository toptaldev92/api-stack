description: AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your webu0026nbsp;applications
  from common web exploits that could affect applicationu0026nbsp;availability, compromise
  security, or consume excessive resources. AWSu0026nbsp;WAF gives you control over
  which traffic to allow or block to your webu0026nbsp;applications by defining customizable
  web security rules. You can use AWSu0026nbsp;WAF to create custom rules that block
  common attack patterns, such as SQLu0026nbsp;injection or cross-site scripting,
  and rules that are designed for your specific application. New rules can be deployed
  within minutes, letting you respondu0026nbsp;quickly to changing traffic patterns.
  Also, AWS WAF includes a full-featuredu0026nbsp;API that you can use to automate
  the creation, deployment, and maintenanceu0026nbsp;of web security rules.nWith AWS
  WAF you pay only for what you use. AWS WAF pricing is based on how many rules you
  deploy and how many web requests your web application receives. There are no upfront
  commitments.nYou can deploy AWS WAF on either Amazon CloudFront as part of your
  CDN solution or the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that fronts your web servers
  or origin servers running on EC2.u0026nbsp;
