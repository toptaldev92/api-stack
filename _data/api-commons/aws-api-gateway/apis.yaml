name: AWS API Gateway
description: Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for
  developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
  With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts
  as a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality
  from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute
  Cloud, code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. Amazon API Gateway handles
  all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of
  concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control,
  monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or
  startup costs. You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data
  transferred out.
