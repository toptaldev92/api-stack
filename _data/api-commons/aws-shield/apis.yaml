description: AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service protection service
  that safeguards web applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection
  and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency,
  so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. There
  are two tiers of AWS Shield, Standard and Advanced. All AWS customers benefit from
  the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge. AWS Shield
  Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport
  layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications.
