name: Wolfram|Alpha
description: Wolfram Research is building a computational knowledge engine called
  Wolfram|Alpha for the web to be launched in May 2009. The product will contain data
  in various u0026nbsp;fields including physical sciences, technology, geography,
  weather, cooking, business, music, etc. in order to provide answers to questions
  that users input. Its language interface will accommodate variations in how users
  frame their questions, such as the use of abbreviations. Wolfram Alphau0026rsquo;s
  vision is to create a system which can do for formal knowledge (heuristics, algorithms,
  rules, methods, theorems, etc.) what search engines like Google have done for informal
  knowledge, such as text and documents.
