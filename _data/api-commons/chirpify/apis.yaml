description: 'We work with brands and agencies who want to leverage social as the
  point of conversion for their multi-channel marketing campaigns. Clients like adidas,
  Mastercard u0026amp; RCA Records use our Social Conversion Platform to activate
  their advertising - enabling consumers to #vote, #donate and #buy directly through
  social channels. Since launching in February of 2012, weu0026rsquo;ve had hundreds
  of brands and merchants launch more than 10,000 campaigns on our platform. And weu0026rsquo;ve
  attracted a great group of investors that includes Voyager Capital, the former CEO
  of McCann Worldgroup, and the CEO of Hootsuite.u0026nbsp;'
