description: Amazon Pinpoint makes it easy to run targeted campaigns to drive user
  engagement in mobile apps. Amazon Pinpoint helps you understand user behavior, define
  which users to target, determine which messages to send, schedule the best time
  to deliver the messages, and then track the results of your campaign.nTargeted push
  notifications based on app usage trends and user behavior have become a popular
  approach for mobile app user engagement because response rates are often several
  times higher than tradition email marketing campaigns. By using targeted push notifications,
  you can increase message relevance and effectiveness, measure engagement, and continually
  improve your campaigns.nGetting started with Amazon Pinpoint is easy. First, AWS
  Mobile Hub guides you through the process to integrate the AWS Mobile SDK with your
  app. Next, you define your target segments, campaign message, and specify the delivery
  schedule. Once your campaign is running, Pinpoint provides metrics so you can run
  analytics and track the impact of your campaign.nWith Amazon Pinpoint, there are
  no upfront setup costs, and no fixed monthly cost. You only pay for the number of
  users your campaign targets, the messages you send, and the events you collect,
  so you can start small and scale as your application grows.
