  title: Ge.tt  REST API
  description: The Ge.tt API allows you to use Ge.tt in your own applications. We
    believe that our users should be able to access their files and share their content
    in their platform of choice. By using the API, developers are able to easily put
    their own content, or the content of their users online. At the same time they
    are able to use Ge.tt's unique real-time file sharing technology where files are
    available before they are even uploaded.
