description: TeamSupport is a web based Customer Service u0026 Help Desk application
  that is all about helping your business provide exceptional customer support through
  better collaboration and teamwork. Most help desk systems are best suited for one-on-one
  communications with your customers and do not focus on the big picture. TeamSupport
  is different, bringing visibility to everyone on your team and enabling full collaboration
  to solve the underlying issues. We strongly believe the best customer support experience
  is rooted in team collaboration. With your staff working as a team, they can easily
  draw on each otheru2019s experience to get the best solution.
