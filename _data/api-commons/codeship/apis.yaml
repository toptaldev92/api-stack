description: Codeship is a hosted Continuous Delivery platform. It helps to release
  software quickly, automatically and multiple times a day. It shortens the development
  cycles thus reducing the risk of bugs and increasing innovation. It helps software
  companies developing a better product faster by taking care of the testing and release
  process. Managing your own continuous deployment system takes time, specialized
  knowledge, custom solutions and dedicated, on-premise infrastructure. Codeship automates
  software deployment and all the necessary tasks involved with it.
