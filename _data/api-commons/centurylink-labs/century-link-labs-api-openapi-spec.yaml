  title: Century Cloud API
  description: The CenturyLink Cloud has a new, improved API for performing the same
    actions programmatically as you can with the Control Portal. The API is RESTful
    and works with JSON messages over HTTP. It relies on the standard HTTP verbs including
    GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
