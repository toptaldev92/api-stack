  title: PagerDuty API
  description: The PagerDuty API provides programmatic access to entities within a
    PagerDuty account. It is designed around [RESTful principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
    with a path structure based on resources and their relationships.All requests
    and responses are serialized in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), including
    error responses.Schema are designed to be reusable across requests and across
    endpoints.More sophisticated API clients should treat PagerDuty resources as unique
    objects keyed by the `id` field that can be used in any API request involving
    resources of that type.Every resource contains a `type` field that identifies
    the schema it uses.## Rate limitingEach account and authentication mechanism is
    limited to the number of API requests it can make every minute. API requests that
    exceed the API rate limit will return an [HTTP status code](error_codes.html#http_responses)
    of 429. Different requests may affect your rate limit differently, so clients
    should always be prepared to be rate limited and respond appropriately.## Read-Only
    API KeysAPI requests made with read-only keys attempting to access endpoints with
    methods other than `GET` will return an [HTTP status code](error_codes.html#http_responses)
    of 403.## Error CodesMost APIs will return an error code from an unsuccessful
    call. They are described [here](error_codes.html).
