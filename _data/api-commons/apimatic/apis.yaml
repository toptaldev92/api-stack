description: When you use APIMATIC to manage SDKs, they provide you with an editor
  for adding, editing, and deleting the details of each API. When you bundles this
  with their multi-format API definition format import and export, the platform quickly
  becomes an API design tool as well as a platform for generating your SDKs.
