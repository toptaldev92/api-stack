description: Cronofy provides a single API for connecting to all calendar services.
  Developers can't choose which calendar services their customers rely on. Supporting
  them all is an unjustifiable development and maintenance burden. We take on that
  burden and in turn are able to offer rich integration at a price point that enables
  an array of valuable use cases
