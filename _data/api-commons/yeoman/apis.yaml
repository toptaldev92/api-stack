description: Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and
  tools to help you stay productive. To do so, we provide a generator ecosystem. A
  generator is basically a plugin that can be run with the `yo` command to scaffold
  complete projects or useful parts. Through our official Generators, we promote the
  Yeoman workflow. This workflow is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprising
  tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications.
  We take care of providing everything needed to get started without any of the normal
  headaches associated with a manual setup.
