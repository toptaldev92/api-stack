name: Apigee API Studio
description: Apigee launched their API Studio out of their earlier Apigee-127 product,
  their work on the Swagger platform and editor, and their BaaS offering, opening
  up the ability for developers to design, mock, test and share via the online platform.
  While Apigee Studio is part of the larger Apigee line of products, it is a separate
  standalone, open source based studio.
