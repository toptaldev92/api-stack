description: The hardest part of working with APIs can be the differences between
  them. Weu0026rsquo;re cataloging u0026amp; normalizing these differences to keep
  you focused on the data. In building our API catalog our mission has been to restore
  focus on data, making it easy to explore and preview API resources. Actual integration
  however is still another matter.
