description: Lattice aspires to make clustering containers easy. Lattice includes
  a cluster scheduler, http load balancing, log aggregation and health management.
  Lattice containers can be long running or temporary tasks which get dynamically
  scaled and balanced across a cluster. Lattice packages components from Cloud Foundry
  to provide a cloud native platform for individual developers and small teams.
