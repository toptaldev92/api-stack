name: AWS EC2 Container Registry Service
description: Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managedu0026nbsp;Dockeru0026nbsp;container
  registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container
  images. Amazon ECR is integrated withu0026nbsp;Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS),
  simplifying your development to production workflow. Amazon ECR eliminates the need
  to operate your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying
  infrastructure. Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highly available and scalable
  architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy containers for your applications.
  Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides resource-level
  control of each repository. With Amazon ECR, there are no upfront fees or commitments.
  You pay only for the amount of data you store in your repositories and data transferred
  to the Internet.
