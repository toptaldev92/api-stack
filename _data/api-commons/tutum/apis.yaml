description: Tutum lets developers easily manage and run lightweight, portable, self-sufficient
  containers from any application. The same container that a developer builds and
  tests on a laptop can run at scale in Tutum. Their solution offers users the best
  capabilities and features of IaaS and PaaS, without the shortcomings or disadvantages
  of either one.
