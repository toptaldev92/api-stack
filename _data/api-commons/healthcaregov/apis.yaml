name: Healthcare.gov
description: HealthCare.gov is a health insurance exchange website operated under
  the United States federal government under the provisions of the Patient Protection
  and Affordable Care Act (ACA, often known as Obamacare), designed to serve the residents
  of the thirty-six U.S. states that opted not to create their own state exchanges.
  The exchange facilitates the sale of private health insurance plans to residents
  of the United States[2] and offers subsidies to those who earn less than four times
  the federal poverty line. The website also assists those persons who are eligible
  to sign up for Medicaid, and has a separate marketplace for small businesses.
