description: The technology team at Magnus Health has developed a robust application
  programming interface (API) that facilitates interaction between your schoolu0026rsquo;s
  information system and Magnus Health. Schools that are already using a student information
  system can take advantage of having a single sign-on (SSO) integration with Magnus
  Healthu0026rsquo;s web-based SMR (student medical record).
