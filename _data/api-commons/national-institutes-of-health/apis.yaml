name: National Institutes of Health
description: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a biomedical research facility
  primarily located in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. An agency of the United States Department
  of Health and Human Services, it is the primary agency of the United States government
  responsible for biomedical and health-related research. The NIH both conducts its
  own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides
  major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural
  Research Program. With 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral
  fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, the IRP is the largest biomedical
  research institution on Earth, while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28%
  of biomedical research funding spent annually in the US, or about US$26.4 billion.
