description: 'Cloud Spanner is the first and only relational database service that
  is both strongly consistent and horizontally scalable. With Cloud Spanner you enjoy
  all the traditional benefits of a relational database: ACID transactions, relational
  schemas (and schema changes without downtime), SQL queries, high performance, and
  high availability. But unlike any other relational database service, Cloud Spanner
  scales horizontally, to hundreds or thousands of servers, so it can handle the highest
  of transactional workloads. With automatic scaling, synchronous data replication,
  and node redundancy, Cloud Spanner delivers up to 99.999% (five 9s) of availability
  for your mission critical applications. In fact, Googleu0026rsquo;s internal Spanner
  service has been handling millions of queries per second from many Google services
  for years.'
