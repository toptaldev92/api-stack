description: 'streamdata.io is a real-time cache proxy allowing you to poll standard
  public REST APIs and push updates to clients. But wait, there is more : streamdata.io
  keeps a history of modifications that occur on the data between two pollings! This
  way, streamdata.io is able to give you the list of modifications which happened
  since last time you fetched the data.'
