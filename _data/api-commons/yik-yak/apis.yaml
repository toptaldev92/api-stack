description: Yik Yak is a social media smartphone application. It is available for
  iOS and Android and it allows people pseudo-anonymously to create and view discussion
  threads within a 5-mile radius (termed Yaks by the application). It is similar to
  other anonymous sharing apps such as Nearby, but differs from others such as Whisper
  in that it is intended for sharing primarily with those in proximity to the user,
  potentially making it more intimate and relevant for people reading the posts. All
  users have the ability to contribute to the stream by writing, responding, and voting
  up or voting down (liking or disliking) yaks.
