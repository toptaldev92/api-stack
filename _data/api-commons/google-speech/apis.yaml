description: Google Cloud Speech API enables developers to convert audio to text by
  applying powerful neural network models in an easy to use API. The API recognizes
  over 80 languages and variants, to support your global user base. You can transcribe
  the text of users dictating to an applicationu0026rsquo;s microphone, enable command-and-control
  through voice, or transcribe audio files, among many other use cases. Recognize
  audio uploaded in the request, and integrate with your audio storage on Google Cloud
  Storage, by using the same technology Google uses to power its own products.
