  payments within their own iOS and Android apps. CardFlightu0026rsquo;s open platform
  connects mobile app developers with payment processors, focusing on the 90+% of
  credit card payments that happen in real life. Developers use CardFlightu0026rsquo;s
  encrypted mag stripe reader and SDK/API so that they can easily and securely accept
  card present payments in their apps, with support for virtually any payment processor
  or merchant account. Our clients retain full control of their integrated app experience
  without dealing with the typical complexity of payments integrations.
