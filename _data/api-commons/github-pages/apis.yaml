description: GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through
  GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Automatic Page Generator
  to create some starter HTML and CSS for us. You can then modify our GitHub Pages
  content and style remotely via the web or locally on our computer.
