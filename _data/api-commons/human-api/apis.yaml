description: Human API can turn disparate health data compiled from dozens of sensors
  and data sources into a meaningful story of a userrsquo;s health, in real time.
  The HumanAPI is an API platform for all human health data. We aggregate, normalize
  and store data drawn from multiple sensors, mobile devices and other data sources
  (such as blood and genetic data). We provide one simple, structured API for interacting
  with all of this health data, regardless of where it comes from.
