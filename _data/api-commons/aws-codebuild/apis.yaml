description: AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code,
  runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild,
  you donu0026rsquo;t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.
  CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your
  builds are not left waiting in a queue. You can get started quickly by using prepackaged
  build environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own
  build tools. With CodeBuild, you are charged by the minute for the compute resources
  you use.
