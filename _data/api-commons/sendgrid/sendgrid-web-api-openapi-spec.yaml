  title: SendGrid Web API
  description: SendGrid offers a Web API that allows customers to retrieve information
    about their account such as statistics, bounces, spam reports, unsubscribes, and
    other information. This API is not RESTful since for most calls both GET and POST
    HTTP verbs can be used interchangeably, and other verbs are not supported.
