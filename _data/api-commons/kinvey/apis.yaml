description: Kinvey (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for
  developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They
  dont have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers
  for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them. With Kinvey, developers simply
  code their app using any SDK of their choice. They then connect the app to Kinveys
  backend features using auto-generated APIs and libraries, and - just like that -
  the app is ready to launch. Well worry about auto-scaling and maintaining your backend.
  You focus solely on your app.
