  creates two web applications for monitoring your websitersquo;s traffic in real-time
  - Dashboard and Trends. Dashboard is a real-time traffic monitoring app that gives
  you an overview of your websitersquo;s traffic right now - in a single glance. It
  lets you see which pages of your site are most popular, where your visitors are
  coming from, and info on every visitor currently browsing your website along with
  how theyrsquo;re browsing (what browser, operating system, screen size, etc.), which
  language theyrsquo;re speaking, and what city theyrsquo;re from. Dashboard doesnrsquo;t
  just tell you whorsquo;s on your site, it also knows what page theyrsquo;re on,
  and what pages theyrsquo;ve been on. It knowrsquo;s where theyrsquo;ve come from
  (Twitter, Digg, Google, etc.) making it easy to see when someonersquo;s talking
  about you. Trends takes all the data in Dashboard and builds beautiful, easy to
  read charts and tables so that you can analyse how your website has been performing
  over the past day, week, month, or year. Trends enables you to gain insights into
  your websitersquo;s traffic data quicker than ever before - without having to click
  a single button.
