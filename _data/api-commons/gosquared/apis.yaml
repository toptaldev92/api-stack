  creates two web applications for monitoring your websiteu0026rsquo;s traffic in
  real-time - Dashboard and Trends. Dashboard is a real-time traffic monitoring app
  that gives you an overview of your websiteu0026rsquo;s traffic right now - in a
  single glance. It lets you see which pages of your site are most popular, where
  your visitors are coming from, and info on every visitor currently browsing your
  website along with how theyu0026rsquo;re browsing (what browser, operating system,
  screen size, etc.), which language theyu0026rsquo;re speaking, and what city theyu0026rsquo;re
  from. Dashboard doesnu0026rsquo;t just tell you whou0026rsquo;s on your site, it
  also knows what page theyu0026rsquo;re on, and what pages theyu0026rsquo;ve been
  on. It knowu0026rsquo;s where theyu0026rsquo;ve come from (Twitter, Digg, Google,
  etc.) making it easy to see when someoneu0026rsquo;s talking about you. Trends takes
  all the data in Dashboard and builds beautiful, easy to read charts and tables so
  that you can analyse how your website has been performing over the past day, week,
  month, or year. Trends enables you to gain insights into your websiteu0026rsquo;s
  traffic data quicker than ever before - without having to click a single button.
