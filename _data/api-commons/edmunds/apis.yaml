description: Here at Edmunds, we believe strongly that innovation is fostered best
  through openness and transparency. Weu0026rsquo;re opening up our data because we
  want to give you, the developer, the ability to explore its potential. You can use
  the breadth and detail of the automotive information available through the Edmunds
  API to create mashups, mobile apps, visualizations and other applications that will
  provide an added dimension of user experience for the automotive consumer. Edmunds
  is committed to helping automotive consumers find the car that meets their every
  need. Providing our data to other developers interested in automotive data is a
  key component to achieving our goal.
