description: The Geoloqi platform offers a complete, cross-platform, language, device
  and carrier agnostic platform for enterprise applications and IP-connected devices.
  A contextually aware solution, it enables persistent background location tracking,
  intelligent battery management, and transitions smoothly between location sources
  such as carrier signals, GPS and Wifi for true real-time tracking. Geoloqiu0026rsquo;s
  API allows developers to build location-aware services and applications without
  having to write code from scratch. Developers can use Geoloqi to easily add automatic
  check-ins, user sign-ups, location-based messaging, event triggers, and real-time
  GPS maps to their existing applications.
