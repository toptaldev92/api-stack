description: Cluster HQs mission is to make enterprise class redundancy, scalability
  u0026amp; business continuity available to every web hosting company in the world.
  Cluster HQ provides global replication of websites, databases and email and automatic
  scalability through live-migration. Its innovative new form of hosting transforms
  commodity infrastructure into co-operative global clusters, responding automatically
  to failures in seconds. This keeps customersu0026rsquo; data safe and servers load-balanced,
  even in the face of a total infrastructure melt-down. Cluster HQ fully embrace cloud
  thinking with our always-on, horizontally scalable, software-HA distributed system,
  running on commodity hardware and/or cloud infrastructure.
