description: Laterals mission is to help people discover the information they need
  when they need it. By enabling developers to integrate machine learning into their
  services, we hope to accelerate discovery, understanding and ultimately collaboration
  across a wide range of disciplines. We identify solutions that benefit from machine
  learning and build modular APIs that are simple to integrate. Our first API is the
  Hybrid Recommender that merges behavioural data and machine intelligence. It solves
  a problem faced by many of how to provide relevant content recommendations to users
  and can work without collaborative data
