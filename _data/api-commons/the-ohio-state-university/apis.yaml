name: The Ohio State University
description: The Ohio State University has a number of APIs, but they are really fragmented
  and all over the place. You can get at some as part of library services, and some
  as part of an data API, and there is another transportation related ones. Lots of
  API profiling work to be done, and pull out all the detail, and organizing it.
