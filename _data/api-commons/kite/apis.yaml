description: Your programming copilot. Kite augments your coding environment with
  all the internetu0026rsquo;s programming knowledge. Your editor and web browser
  dont know anything about each other, which is why you end up continuously switching
  between them. Kite bridges that gap, bringing an internet-connected programming
  experience right alongside your editor.
