name: City of London
description: The London Datastore has been created by the Greater London Authority
  (GLA) as an innovation towards freeing Londonu0026rsquo;s data. We want citizens
  to be able access the data that the GLA and other public sector organisations hold,
  and to use that data however they see fit u0026ndash; free of charge. The GLA is
  committed to influencing and cajoling other public sector organisations into releasing
  their data here too.
