description: CloudRail is the standard interface for the intelligent and interoperable
  Internet of tomorrow. It is a universal API that works with any system and is able
  to automatically adapt to new services due to an innovative learning method. With
  CloudRail the Internet becomes one huge ecosystem where everything works together
  immediately out of the box. Software developers only have to use a single interface
  to access all services and thus can speed up the development process rapidly. Service
  providers can finally create perfectly integrated solutions and realize benefits
  from a huge developer ecosystem.
