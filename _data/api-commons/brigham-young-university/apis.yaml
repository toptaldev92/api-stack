description: Brigham Young University has the most APIs Ive come across with any of
  my university research. While many are still SOAP services, they are actively working
  to evolve them. BYU is also leading the conversation when it comes to university
  API design, and holding university API conferences, bringing together other institutions
  together to share API knowledge.
