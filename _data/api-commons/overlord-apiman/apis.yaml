description: Any computer system, whether it is centralized or distributed, needs
  some form of governance, i.e., the act of monitoring and managing the system. Such
  governance may be as simple as ensuring only authorized users have access to capabilities
  (e.g. services), or as complex as guaranteeing the system and its components maintain
  a level of availability or reliability in the presence of failures or increased
  system load. Managing distributed systems has always been a critical aspect for
  users, developers and administrators. As those distributed systems grew in scope
  and scalability, spanning multiple organizations with different infrastructures
  and trust boundaries, governance became more difficult but even more important.
  Governance deals with the processes by which a system operates. In order to have
  successful governance, some form of management, monitoring and administration is
  required for these processes.
