  description: Etsy is the world's most vibrant handmade marketplace. The Etsy API
    lets developers tap into the Etsy community, building their own Etsy-powered applications
    for the web, desktop and mobile devices. We hope the API will help connect buyers
    with sellers, promote the handmade lifestyle, and support the craftspeople who
    sell on Etsy.
