name: AnyPresence
description: AnyPresence is a mobile development platform that dramatically reduces
  the time and cost of mobile-enabling enterprise business processes, products, and
  services. It is the only solution that offers organizations the ability to assemble
  and deploy backend servers, native iOS, native Android, and HTML5 mobile web apps
  without platform lock-in. u0026nbsp;Powered by a robust mobile backend-as-a-service
  (MBaaS), AnyPresence also provides pre-assembled mobile app templates, a design-time
  API, and other patent-pending capabilities to further accelerate time-to-market.
  The platform is easy to use, yet flexible enough to enable source code-level customization
  or on-premise hosting options.
