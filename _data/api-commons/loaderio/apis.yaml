description: Loader.io is a free load testing service that allows you to stress test
  your web-apps/apis with thousands of concurrent connections. We were born out of
  SendGrid Labs which is a new and growing internal effort at SendGrid. Born in late
  2012, SendGrid Labs builds tools and services to help developers focus on their
  core business. We aim to provide creative and innovative solutions to common developer
  pain points, to make their lives easier, and to help them scale.
