description: Too often, interactions with the government are burdensome and frustrating.
  From seeking out financing opportunities to learning about the latest regulations
  affecting them, hard-working businesses are spending too much time navigating the
  federal bureaucracy. On October 28, 2011, the President issued a challenge to government
  agencies to think beyond their organizational boundaries in the best interest of
  serving Americas business community, and start thinking and acting more like the
  businesses they serve.
