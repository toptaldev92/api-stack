description: AVIN is essentially the equivalent of an ISBN for wine bottles. That
  is a unique number which identifies a bottle of wine by producer, grape, vintage.
  nnThe AVIN is now being printed in over 25 million wine labels.nnAVINs make a specific
  wine easier to find. An AVIN is a 13 digit number which looks like this AVIN6452997073019.
  The number is stored in a large database with all the details of the wine. A wine
  can then be referred to by its AVIN through Google, stock control systems or anywhere
  else. It starts to become more interesting when an AVIN is blended with something
  else.nnJust one of the interesting ways in which AVINs are being used is with QR
  codes. By providing a QR code, you are creating a dynamic or interactive wine label
  which brings the wine drinker to a page with information from several different
  wine sites and includes reviews, prices and other information.
