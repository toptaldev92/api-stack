name: DuckDuckGo
description: DuckDuckGo is an Internet search engine that uses information from crowdsourced
  websites such as Wikipedia to obtain its results. The search engine policy says
  that it protects privacy, and does not record user information. Because users are
  not profiled, the filter bubble can be avoided, with all users being shown the same
  search results for a given search term.
