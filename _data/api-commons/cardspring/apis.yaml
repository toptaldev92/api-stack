description: Cardspring is creating an application platform that will allow Web and
  mobile developers to write applications for credit cards and other types of payments.
  Cardspring attaches itself to the payment network in a secure fashion on one side,
  and on the other it presents itself as a platform for developers to create payment
  apps via Web-standard APIs. It is a bridge between the two networks.nnThese applications
  could include things like electronic coupons, loyalty cards, virtual currencies,
  or yet-to-be-imagined commerce apps.
