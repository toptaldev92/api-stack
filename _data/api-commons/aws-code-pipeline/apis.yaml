name: AWS Code Pipeline
description: AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and
  move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premise
  data sources, at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly
  access your data where itu0026rsquo;s stored, transform and process it at scale,
  and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS,
  Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.nAWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex
  data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available.
  You donu0026rsquo;t have to worry about ensuring resource availability, managing
  inter-task dependencies, retrying transient failures or timeouts in individual tasks,
  or creating a failure notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to
  move and process data that was previously locked up in on-premise data silos.
