name: AWS Cognito
description: Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and sign-in to your mobile
  and web apps. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the options to authenticate users
  through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML
  identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. In addition, Amazon Cognito
  enables you to save data locally on users devices, allowing your applications to
  work even when the devices are offline. You can then synchronize data across users
  devices so that their app experience remains consistent regardless of the device
  they use. With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead
  of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management,
  authentication, and sync across devices.
