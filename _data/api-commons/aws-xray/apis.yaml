description: AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed
  applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray,
  you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing
  to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray
  provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application,
  and shows a map of your applicationu0026rsquo;s underlying components. You can use
  X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple
  three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands
  of services.
