  description: Using the USA TODAY Articles API, anybody is capable of constructing
    their own custom feeds for USA TODAY stories going back to 2004. Stories may be
    retrieved a number of ways, including pulling editorially prioritized content
    by section, employing either basic search or tag search, or calling feeds for
    one of the USA TODAY communities. All article feeds are available in both RSS
    and JSON formatting.
