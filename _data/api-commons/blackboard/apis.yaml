description: We are sick and tired of spending too much time implementing the aspects
  of web services. Things like security, configuration and deployment should be completely
  automated. We want to ship, and just focus on the functionality of our applications.
  Basically, creating and hosting Web Services is just too complex. We need a platform
  that allows you to create web services by just using your browser and focusing only
  the functionality of your service; because, honestly, nothing else matters. iKnode
  is that platform. iKnode will take care of all of the other aspects of your service
  and make it easily accessible for your applications.
