name: Open Badges
description: A digital badge is an online representation of a skill youu0026rsquo;ve
  earned. Open Badges take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify
  your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations. And because
  the system is based on an open standard, you can combine multiple badges from different
  issuers to tell the complete story of your achievements u0026mdash; both online
  and off. Display your badges wherever you want them on the web, and share them for
  employment, education or lifelong learning.
