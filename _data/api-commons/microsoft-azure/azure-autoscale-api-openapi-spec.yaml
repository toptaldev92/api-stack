  title: Azure Autoscale API
  description: Autoscale is a built-in feature of Cloud Services, Mobile Services,
    Virtual Machines, and Websites that helps applications perform their best when
    demand changes. Of course, performance means different things for different applications.
    Some apps are CPU-bound, others memory-bound. For example, you could have a web
    app that handles millions of requests during the day and none at night. Autoscale
    can scale your service by any of these&mdash;or by a custom metric you define.
