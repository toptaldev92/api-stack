description: Welcome to Metro Governmentu2019s Open Data Portal. As part of Nashvilleu2019s
  Open Data Initiative, this site is the destination for the public to access Metro
  Government data in a new way. My signing of the Metro Nashville Open Data Executive
  Order outlines my belief that by pushing datasets out, Metro departments and agencies
  empower the public to partner with Metro Government. Through this site, we aim to
  co-create with civic technologists innovative web resources, insightful analytics
  on public programs and services, and new civic apps for the community. Visit us
  often for updates. I look forward to seeing where our communityu2019s creativity
  and exploration of open data will take us.n
