description: DBpedia is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information
  from Wikipedia and make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you
  to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link the different data sets
  on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope that this work will make it easier for the
  huge amount of information in Wikipedia to be used in some new interesting ways.
  Furthermore, it might inspire new mechanisms for navigating, linking, and improving
  the encyclopedia itself.
