description: 'Please join us for a two-day, three-night Open Space conference led
  by us, the API Craft community! Together, we will continue to answer the question:
  Where do we lead the APIs of tomorrow? As a community we possess the knowledge and
  experience to set the course for API best practices. Our diverse backgrounds and
  opinions will come together as we meet face-to-face to hash out a plan for pushing
  forward the state of the art of APIs.'
