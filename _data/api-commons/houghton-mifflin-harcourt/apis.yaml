description: Houghton Mifflin Harcourts (HMH) Developer Portal is an HMH Labs initiative
  to expose the HMH APIs to others, including customers and third party developers.
  This creates an exciting opportunity for developers to build solutions that are
  compatible with those that our customers already know and trust. Initially, the
  APIs will connect with a sandbox environment and, down the road, with the rich and
  diverse world of Houghton Mifflin Harcourts offerings. Ultimately, our goal is to
  provide greater opportunities for interoperability and a seamless user experience
  for teachers, students and parents.
