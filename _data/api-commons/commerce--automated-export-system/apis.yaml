name: Commerce - Automated Export System
description: The Automated Export System (AES) is the system used by U.S. exporters
  to electronically declare their international exports, known as Electronic Export
  Information (EEI), to the Census Bureau to help compile U.S. export and trade statistics.
  This information is also shared with the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Directorate
  of Defense Trade Controls, and other federal agencies involved in monitoring and
  validating U.S. exports.[1] Formerly, this declaration was only made on paper on
  the Shippers Export Declaration form.
