description: Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly
  lets you create applications that talk, enabling you to build entirely new categories
  of speech-enabled products. Polly is an Amazon AI service that uses advanced deep
  learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Polly
  includes 47 lifelike voices spread across 24 languages, so you can select the ideal
  voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries.nAmazon
  Polly delivers the consistently fast response times required to support real-time,
  interactive dialog. You can cache and save Pollyu0026rsquo;s speech audio to replay
  offline or redistribute. And Polly is easy to use. You simply send the text you
  want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly immediately returns the audio
  stream to your application so your application can play it directly or store it
  in a standard audio file format, such as MP3.nWith Polly, you only pay for the number
  of characters you convert to speech, and you can save and replay Pollyu0026rsquo;s
  generated speech. Pollyu0026rsquo;s low cost per character converted, and lack of
  restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way
  to enable Text-to-Speech everywhere.
