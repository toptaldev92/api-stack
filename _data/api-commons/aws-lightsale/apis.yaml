name: AWS Lightsale
description: Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers
  who just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you need to
  launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer,
  DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those
  Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line
  interface (CLI).
