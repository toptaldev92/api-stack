description: 'Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for
  developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
  With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts
  as a u201cfront dooru201d for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality
  from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute
  Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. '
