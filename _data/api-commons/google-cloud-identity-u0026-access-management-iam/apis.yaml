  authorize who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and
  visibility to manage cloud resources centrally. For established enterprises with
  complex organizational structures, hundreds of workgroups and potentially many more
  projects, Cloud IAM provides a unified view into security policy across your entire
  organization, with built-in auditing to ease compliance processes.
