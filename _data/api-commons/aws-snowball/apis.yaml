name: AWS Snowball
description: Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
  appliances tou0026nbsp;transfer large amounts of datau0026nbsp;into and out of theu0026nbsp;AWS
  cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers
  including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring
  data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the
  cost of high-speed Internet.nWith Snowball, you donu0026rsquo;t need to write any
  code or purchase any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the
  AWS Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to
  you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download and
  run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the client to select
  the file directories that you want to transfer to the appliance. The client will
  then encrypt and transfer the files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer
  is complete and the appliance is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label
  will automatically update and you can track the job status viau0026nbsp;Amazon Simple
  Notification Service (SNS), text messages, or directly in the Console.nSnowball
  uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant
  enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module
  (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once
  the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure
  of the Snowball appliance.
