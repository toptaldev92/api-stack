description: The SaferBus API is a RESTful service API provided by FMCSA for the purpose
  of making available, the safety performance data of U.S. Department of Transportation
  (U.S. DOT) registered bus companies. The primary goal is to encourage the development
  of products, tools or services that can help consumers more easily check the safety
  record of bus companies to avoid those that have been placed out of service or those
  that do not have the proper operating authority.u0026nbsp;
