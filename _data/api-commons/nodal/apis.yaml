name: Nodal
description: Nodal is a web server for Node.js, optimized for building API services
  quickly and efficiently. Boasting its own opinionated, explicit, idiomatic and highly-extensible
  framework, Nodal takes care of all of the hard decisions for you and your team.
  This allows you to focus on creating an effective product in a short timespan while
  minimizing technical debt. Nodal projects are ready to deploy to Heroku right out
  of the box, so you can have your website live in no time.n
