name: Digital Public Library of America
description: 'The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is a project aimed at bringing
  about a large-scale public digital library. It was launched by Harvard Universitys
  Berkman Center for Internet amp; Society in 2010, with financial support from the
  Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and several other funders. It aims to unify such disparate
  sources as the Library of Congress, the Internet Archive, various academic collections,
  and presumably any other collection that would be meaningful to include. ... They
  have yet to ... decide such issues as how near to the present their catalog will
  come. There is an ongoing dispute regarding so-called orphan works and other questions
  of copyright. John Palfrey, co-director of the Berkman Center, stated in 2011: We
  aspire to establish a system whereby all Americans can gain access to information
  and knowledge in digital formats in a manner that is free to all. It is by no means
  a plan to replace libraries, but rather to create a common resource for libraries
  and patrons of all types.rdquo;'
