name: Digital Public Library of America
description: 'The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is a project aimed at bringing
  about a large-scale public digital library. It was launched by Harvard Universitys
  Berkman Center for Internet u0026amp; Society in 2010, with financial support from
  the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and several other funders. It aims to unify such
  disparate sources as the Library of Congress, the Internet Archive, various academic
  collections, and presumably any other collection that would be meaningful to include.
  ... They have yet to ... decide such issues as how near to the present their catalog
  will come. There is an ongoing dispute regarding so-called orphan works and other
  questions of copyright. John Palfrey, co-director of the Berkman Center, stated
  in 2011: We aspire to establish a system whereby all Americans can gain access to
  information and knowledge in digital formats in a manner that is free to all. It
  is by no means a plan to replace libraries, but rather to create a common resource
  for libraries and patrons of all types.u0026rdquo;'
