name: OpenShift by Red Hat
description: OpenShift is a cloud computing platform as a service product from Red
  Hat. A version for private cloud is named OpenShift Enterprise. The software that
  runs the service is open-sourced under the name OpenShift Origin, and is available
  on GitHub. Developers can use Git to deploy web applications in different languages
  on the platform. OpenShift also supports binary programs that are web applications,
  so long as they can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This allows the use of arbitrary
  languages and frameworks. OpenShift takes care of maintaining the services underlying
  the application and scaling the application as needed.
