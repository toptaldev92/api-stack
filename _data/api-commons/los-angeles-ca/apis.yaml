description: We are sharing city data with the public to increase transparency, accountability
  and customer service and to empower companies, individuals and non-profit organizations
  with the ability to harness a vast array of useful information to improve life in
  our city. I hope that this data will help drive innovation and problem solving within
  the public and private sectors and that Angelenos will use it to more deeply understand
  and engage with their city. I encourage you to explore data.lacity.org to conduct
  research, develop apps or simply to poke around.
