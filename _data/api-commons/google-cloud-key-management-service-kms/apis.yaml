name: Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)
description: Cloud KMS is a cloud-hosted key management service that lets you manage
  encryption for your cloud services the same way you do on-premises. You can generate,
  use, rotate and destroy AES256 encryption keys. Cloud KMS is integrated with IAM
  and Cloud Audit Logging so that you can manage permissions on individual keys, and
  monitor how these are used. Use Cloud KMS to protect secrets and other sensitive
  data which you need to store in Google Cloud Platform.
