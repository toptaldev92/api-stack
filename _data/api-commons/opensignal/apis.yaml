description: With your help, were creating a comprehensive database of cell phone
  towers, cell phone signal strength readings, and Wi-Fi access points around the
  world. Our goal is to become the global authority on wireless networks. On this
  website we provide visualizations and analysis based on the data weve collected,
  including cellular coverage maps that show exactly how strong signal is in any particular
  area, as well as all the nearby towers for your carrier. Take a look around, and
  feel free to contact us if you have any questions or feedback.
