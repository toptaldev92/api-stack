name: Asterank
description: Asterank is a scientific and economic database of over 600,000 asteroids.
  u0026nbsp;Weve collected, computed, or inferred important data such as asteroid
  mass and composition from multiple scientific sources. With this information, we
  estimate the costs and rewards of mining asteroids. u0026nbsp;Details on orbits
  and basic physical parameters are sourced from the Minor Planet Center and NASA
  JPL. Composition data is based on spectral classification and size. Our calculations
  incorporate conclusions from multiple scientific publications in addition to cross-referencing
  known meteorite data.
