description: ShiftPlanning is workforce management for the 21st century. Our easy
  to use online application is centralized meaning that its always up to date and
  everyone has access to the most up to date information. ShiftPlanning, just as all
  successful startups, was created to fill a strong need that nobody was serving.
  For years, most businesses relied on pen and paper, excel spreadsheets and lots
  and lots of headache medication to ensure their staff showed up on time for work
  with happy smiles all over their faces.
