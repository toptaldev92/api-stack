description: Envirofacts has developed a RESTful data service API to all of its internal
  data holdings. This functionality provides a user of Envirofacts with the ability
  to query any table through the use of a URL. The default output is in XML, which
  can be utilized in other applications, as well as tools such as Microsoft Excel
  or Access. Output options of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), CSV, and Excel can
  be requested in the URL. The entire Envirofacts database metadata is available online,
  so that all tables and columns within Envirofacts are documented. Having the table
  structures available in this manner makes most of Envirofacts data easily available
  through the service.
