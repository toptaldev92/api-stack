  description: We let developers spend their time on their application code, not building
    a brand new encoding system from scratch. Formerly HeyWatch and founded in 2006,
    Coconut is a cloud-based video encoding platform that lets developers move video
    encoding to the cloud with just a few lines of code. We know that developers spend
    a lot of time on their application code, so we want to make things easier and more
    productive for them offering beautiful code, API and documentation.
