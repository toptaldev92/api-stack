  description: Etsy is a website that focuses on handmade and vintage items, as well
    as art and craft supplies. The items include art, photography, clothing, jewelry,
    edibles, quilts, and toys. Etsy is modeled after open craft fairs that give sellers
    personal storefronts where they can list their goods. The company charges users
    a flat listing fee (of 20 cents per items), and takes a commission of 3.5% off all
    items sold. Since its launch in June 2005, the site has continually added new widgets
    and features, and has seen corresponding growth.
