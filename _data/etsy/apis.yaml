- "{\n\t\"name\": \"Etsy\",\n\t\"description\": \"Etsy is a website that focuses
    on handmade and vintage items, as well as art and craft supplies. The items include
    art, photography, clothing, jewelry, edibles, quilts, and toys. Etsy is modeled
    after open craft fairs that give sellers personal storefronts where they can list
    their goods. The company charges users a flat listing fee (of 20 cents per items),
    and takes a commission of 3.5% off all items sold. Since its launch in June 2005,
    the site has continually added new widgets and features, and has seen corresponding
    growth.\",\n\t\"image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/613742962095341568/VGmQvBw8_normal.png\",\n\t\"x-open-ranking\":
