- "{\n\t\"name\": \"Viddler\",\n\t\"description\": \"Viddler is a video site that
    allows users to upload, enhance and share their video from their browser. The site
    charges premium fees to users who want to use upgraded features, and also allows
    users to upload in bulk, add deep tags at specific times during videos and record
    directly from their webcam. In November 2007 viddler introduced an ad system enabling
    advertisers to bid on videos with relevant keyword tags about the whole video or
    a specific point in time during the video with the keyword tag in question.  As
    part of the ad system rollout, uploaders can also sign up to partner in a revenue
    share with viddler for advertising served during their videos.\",\n\t\"image\":
