  description: Viddler is a video site that allows users to upload, enhance and share
    their video from their browser. The site charges premium fees to users who want
    to use upgraded features, and also allows users to upload in bulk, add deep tags
    at specific times during videos and record directly from their webcam. In November
    2007 viddler introduced an ad system enabling advertisers to bid on videos with
    relevant keyword tags about the whole video or a specific point in time during the
    video with the keyword tag in question.  As part of the ad system rollout, uploaders
    can also sign up to partner in a revenue share with viddler for advertising served
    during their videos.
