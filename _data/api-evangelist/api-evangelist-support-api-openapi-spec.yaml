    title: API Evangelist - Support API
    description: I've been tracking on the ways that leading companies who are doing
      APis handle their support for some time now. I've been formalizing my research,
      and organizing it here. I will keep working to organize better, and produce guides,
      and tooling. To help drive some of it I have also developed an API that will help
      me manage my open APIs, as well as the support on others.
