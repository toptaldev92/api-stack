  description: APImetrics builds on 3 years experience gained working on the challenge
    of API abstraction and management that is critical to every App and Web Service
    in use today. By combining elements gained from API management tools and authentication
    technologies, APImetrics have been able to build the first, complete, end-to-end
    API performance test solution. This allows developers, enterprises and API providers
    to model complex API scenarios and provide them with real time monitoring and alerts
    when things go wrong.
