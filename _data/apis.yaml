name: Stack
description: The API Stack is an interactive, published list of companies that I'm
  watching in the API space. I regularly go through my list of companies in my CRM
  and high grade them, and promote or demote them on my monitoring list. The API Stack
  is meant to be a reflection of this research, published in a way that others can
  browse, and fork.
