    title: Ge.tt  REST API
    description: The Ge.tt API allows you to use Ge.tt in your own applications. We
      believe that our users should be able to access their files and share their content
      in their platform of choice. By using the API, developers are able to easily put
      their own content, or the content of their users online. At the same time they
      are able to use Ge.tt's unique real-time file sharing technology where files are
      available before they are even uploaded.
