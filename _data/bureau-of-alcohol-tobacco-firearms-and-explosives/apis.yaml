    description: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF, BATF,
      and BATFE) is a federal law enforcement organization within the United States
      Department of Justice.[4] Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention
      of federal offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture and possession of
      firearms and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of
      alcohol and tobacco products. The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession,
      and transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce.
      Many of ATFs activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up
      of state and local law enforcement officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods.
      ATF operates a unique fire research laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where
      full-scale mock-ups of criminal arson can be reconstructed.
