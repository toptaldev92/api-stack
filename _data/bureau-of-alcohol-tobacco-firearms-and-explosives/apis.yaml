    \"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF, BATF, and BATFE)
    is a federal law enforcement organization within the United States Department of
    Justice.[4] Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention of federal
    offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture and possession of firearms and
    explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco
    products. The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession, and transportation
    of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce. Many of ATFs activities
    are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up of state and local law enforcement
    officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods. ATF operates a unique fire research
    laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where full-scale mock-ups of criminal arson
    can be reconstructed.\",\n\t\"image\": \"http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/399px-US-AlcoholTobaccoFirearmsAndExplosives-Seal.svg.png\",\n\t\"x-open-ranking\":
