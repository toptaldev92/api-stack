- name: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
  description: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF, BATF, and
    BATFE) is a federal law enforcement organization within the United States Department
    of Justice.[4] Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention of
    federal offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture and possession of firearms
    and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of alcohol and
    tobacco products. The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession, and
    transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce. Many
    of ATFs activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up of state
    and local law enforcement officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods. ATF operates
    a unique fire research laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where full-scale mock-ups
    of criminal arson can be reconstructed.
