    description: An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a way for two computer
      applications to talk to each other in a common language that they both understand.
      NPR's API is a content API, which essentially provides a structured way for other
      computer applications to get NPR stories in a predictable, flexible and powerful
      way. The content that is available includes audio from most NPR programs dating
      back to 1995 as well as text, images and other web-only content from NPR and NPR
      member stations. This archive consists of over 250,000 stories that are grouped
      into more than 5,000 different aggregations.
