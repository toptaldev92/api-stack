          description: Json model with asset usages to report. Supports up to 1000 usages
            per batch. Given the atomic nature of the operation,rn             all Image
            Ids included in a request must be valid for the batch to be recorded. Batches
            containing an invalid Image Id will cause the operationrn             to
            fail and return an error response. In this case, none of the reported usages
            will be recorded.
