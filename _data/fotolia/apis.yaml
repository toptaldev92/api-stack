  description: Fotolia is a low-priced stock photography site, offering over 16 million
    images for publishing and advertising, at prices as low as $0.75 per photo. Unlike
    the two major players in stock photo sales (Corbis and Getty), Fotolia&rsquo;s images
    are mostly from semi-pro and amateur photographers, though the photos are of similar
    quality. Fotolia photographers earn 30%-60% of the sales revenue from their images.
