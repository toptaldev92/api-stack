Both teams can invite as many users as they want in their channel, rename it, or make it private.

Our built-in request logging makes them equally easy to debug on-the-fly. Webscripts can also be activated on a schedule, providing a simple way to build monitoring or other automation.",

Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them. But algorithms are also a reminder that visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data. Visualization leverages the human visual system to augment human intellect: we can use it to better understand these important abstract processes, and perhaps other things, too.",

Employees often get bored of long-lasting, boring corporate wellness platforms, so Addo works in campaigns instead. Once the account is created, your team will have a week to prepare for the first campaign which lasts 21 days: long enough to start getting into certain habits, but short enough not to get bored. At the end of a campaign, the entire team can see a colourful report of how they did, with graphs and information on their performance. u0026nbsp;Reward the winners and congratulate everyone for the effort and start preparing for the next campaign! Addo makes wellness fun, and our mascot, the Addo Wolf, keeps us company at every step of the way. Someday, you might even get to chat with the Addo Wolf through slack ;)",

It alerts users of malicious URL/files before the user clicks and gets compromised.nnReally another Bot? For what?nSlack is becoming the operating system for businesses. It is not just a collaboration tool. It is becoming a single place where people chat, exchange technical information, collect the tweets, news articles of their interest, automate their processes etc. With this level of content flowing into Slack from users and also automated sources, there is no security on the content today. The content can be malicious and then end up spreading across your organization very quickly.nnTake an example u2013 you have subscribed to feed for competitive white papers with a pattern match which gets delivered into Slack via an email or some other integration. This trigger results in a malicious file getting delivered to your Slack channel or a URL which hosts malware on it. At this time your entire slack can click on it and suddenly everybody in compromised. This is faster than even email spreading the malware.nnEffectively, DBOT provides security for Slack users and also enables security automation for security analysts using Slack.",

On setup, the admin connects a Slack channel with a MeisterTask project and section. Using a simple syntax, users can then post new tasks / bugs / feature ideas directly from that channel. A confirmation message will be shown on the Slack channel after creation of the task and the task in MeisterTask will contain a link back to the exact point in the Slack conversation where it was created from.rnrnSyntax and Example:rn```rn/mt task title[: description][@assignee][@watcher][+checklist item][+checklist item]rn/mt iPad improvements +Fix landscape mode +Support touch ID @Oliverrn```",

		"details": "TestFairy helps mobile developers test their apps better by providing them with videos, showing what exactly happened on the app before it crashed or before something went wrong. Our Slack integration can be used to get notifications on crashes, feedback submitted from testers, new versions that were uploaded to the service, or even download notifications for specific users. As a project manager, you would probably want to receive real-time notifications when a tester you invited has downloaded your app, or when a new version has been made available for download. As a developer, you may want to receive real time notifications when your app crashed, with an attachment of the recorded session. A record session is information including the video, cpu/memory metrics, application logs and plenty of other stuff. User feedbacks are relevant to anyone in the team. For every new feedback (tester shakes a device, provides textual feedback, or sketches a screenshot) you will be notified, with all relevant information, and most important, the video that shows what exactly happened before your user complained.",

Decisions are trapped in email threads where no-one can see them. Itu2019s hard to know where to go to get feedback. Company-wide emails become a nuisance. Chat is great for quick, transactional communication. But thought-out write-ups and threaded discussions are where the real communication gets done thats keep everyone on the same page. This u201clow-gearu201d style of communication is crucial to coordinating and setting a vision for high impact projects. Tettra is a company wiki, built on Slack.
