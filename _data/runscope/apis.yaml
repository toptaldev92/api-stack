  description: Runscope was started with the idea that depending on a web service API
    in a mobile or web application should be as easy as depending on code running locally.
    We&rsquo;ve assembled a team of API, infrastructure and developer experience experts
    to build tools to support the modern application development lifecycle.

    description: |-
      Built to support the modern application development lifecycle, Runscope is a suite of developer tools allowing users to debug, test and share HTTP or REST API calls. The Runscope API provides developers with programmatic access to data in their Runscope accounts.
      The API accepts requests sent over HTTPS, returns JSON formatted data, and supports OAuth2 authentication.
