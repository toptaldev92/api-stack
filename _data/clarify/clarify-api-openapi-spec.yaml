        description: Gets the list of bundles. Links to each item are in the _links

          use the <b>first</b>, <b>last</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>prev</b> link relations
          to get more bundles in the list. Note that <b>next</b> will not be available
          at the end of the list and <b>prev</b> will not be available at the start
          of the list. If the results are exactly one page neither <b>prev</b> nor <b>next</b>
          will be available.<br/><br/>The <b>embed</b> parameter specifies link relations
          to embed in the results. The models for the specified link relations will
          be in an array in the embedded object with the link relation as the key. For
          example, if you do embed=items, _embedded will contain a property <b>items</b>
          whose value is the array of bundle models. For link relations that are curies
          (ex. clarify:metadata), you may simply use the base name (ex. metadata).

        description: 'Create a new bundle with the specified name, media url, and optional
          JSON metadata.<br/><br/><b>name</b> can be any string you wish to associate
          with the bundle.<br/><br/><b>media_url</b> must be a publicly accessible url
          to a media file. It will be fetched asynchronously after the REST call returns.
          The audio can be mono or stereo.<br/><br/><b>audio_channel</b> is used to
          specify audio channels if the media is a stereo file. A value of <i>left</i>
          or <i>right</i> signifies that only the specified channel will be used. If
          no value or an empty string is specified for <b>audio_channel</b>, all channels
          will be used in a single track. If your stereo channels were recorded separately
          with each channel containing distinct content (for example if 2 legs of a
          phone call were recorded separately and combined into a single stereo file),
          for best speech recognition, create two tracks, with <b>audio_channel</b>
          set to <i>left</i> and <i>right</i> in each track respectively. If your stereo
          file is simply a recording made with a stereo microphone, <b>audio_channel</b>
          should be set to an empty string (or not be specified.) If you have audio
          channels as separate media files, after creating the bundle with one <b>media_url</b>,
          POST another <b>media_url</b> to /bundles/{bundle_id}/tracks.<br/><br/><b>metadata</b>
          is a single-level JSON object of your own definition, containing key-values
          that can be searched and filtered on. Metadata can be used to hold text such
          as names, titles, descriptions and values for segregating bundles, for example
          by user, topic, folder name etc. The keys (property names) can be up to 64
          characters and must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscore (but
          not start with underscore) and must not be a reserved name. Reserved names
          are &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, and &quot;null&quot;. Values can
          be strings, numbers, boolean true/false, date-times represented as a string
          in ISO 8601 format (ex. &quot;2014-02-25T14:23:45.000Z&quot;), or an array
          of these primitive types. Strings can be up to 2000 characters and strings
          in arrays can be up to 128 characters each. Nested objects are not allowed.
          Metadata can contain up to 50 key-value pairs up to a total JSON size of 4000

          server to which notifications for the bundle will be POSTed.<br/><br/>There
          are two types of notifications: Track Notifications and Bundle Notifications.
          Track Notifications are sent when the status of a track in the bundle changes
          to an end state, either <b>ready</b> or <b>error</b>. Handling Track Notifications
          will allow you to know if a media fetch or media format error has occurred.
          Bundle Notifications are sent when media processing has completed on a bundle
          and they will allow you to know the cost of the media processing. For both
          types of notifications, the POST body is a HAL JSON message containing the
          <b>bundle_id</b>, bundle <b>name</b> and <b>external_id</b> if they have been
          set, as well as other data and standard Clarify link relations. See <a href=#bundles_v1bundlesbundle_id_put_3

        description: 'Add a new track to a bundle. This will insert or append a new
          track in the tracks array or return an error if the maximum number of tracks
          (4) has been reached or the track number specifies an invalid index.<br/><br/>A
          track is immutable, meaning that once it has been added, it cannot be modified.
          If you wish to modify a track, simply add a new one and delete the existing
          one.<br/><br/><b>label</b> is a short name for the track.<br/><br/><b>media_url</b>
          must be a publicly accessible url to a media file. It will be fetched asynchronously
          after the REST call returns. The audio can be mono or stereo.<br/><br/><b>audio_channel</b>
          is used to specify audio channels if the media is a stereo file. A value of
          <i>left</i> or <i>right</i> signifies that only the specified channel will
          be used. If no value or an empty string is specified for <b>audio_channel</b>,
          all channels will be used in a single track. If your stereo channels were
          recorded separately with each channel containing distinct content (for example
          if 2 legs of a phone call were recorded separately and combined into a single
          stereo file), for best speech recognition, create two tracks with <b>audio_channel</b>
          to be <i>left</i> and <i>right</i>. If your stereo file is simply a recording
          made with a stereo microphone, <b>audio_channel</b> should be set to an empty
          string (or not be specified.)<br/><br/><b>audio_language</b> can be used to
          specify the language of the audio media. This is an optional parameter and
          if not specified or an empty string, the language of the track will be automatically
          detected. If specified, it must be a language code as described in RFC5646
          (see <a href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646 target=_blank>http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646</a>).
          Supported languages: en-US.<br/><br/><b>track</b> is the index in the tracks
          array where the new track will be added. Track numbers start at 0. If this
          parameter is not specified the new track will always be appended to the end
          of the array. If the track specified is greater than the last index of the
          array + 1, an error will be returned.<br/><br/>If <b>version</b> specified,
          the track will only be added if the current version matches this parameter
          value. If the version doesnt match, a 409 Conflict error will be returned.
          If version not specified, the track will always be updated.'
