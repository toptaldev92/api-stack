  description: Clarify makes what was said, searchable. As the world records more and
    more of its interactions, in more and more ways, it needs a new generation of tools
    to filter, manage, and process the raw data. Clarifys API, SDKs and plugins enable
    developers and entrepreneurs to add audio and video search to any application. Clarify
    is already being used by disruptors and innovators, as well as some of the world&rsquo;s
    largest institutions.
