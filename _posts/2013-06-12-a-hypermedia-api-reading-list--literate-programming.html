<p>Originally, this post was titled A RESTful Reading List, but please note that REST is over.Hypermedia API is the new nomenclature.Ive been doing an intense amount of research on Hypermedia APIs over the last few months, and while I didnt save every resource I found, Ive made a list here of the most important.Ill be updating this post as I get new resources, so check back!The book list If you want to go from nothing to everything, you can do it by reading just a few books, actually.</p>
