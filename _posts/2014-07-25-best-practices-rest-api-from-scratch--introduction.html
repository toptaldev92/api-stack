<p>The current internet ecosystem has literally been invaded by APIs, and for good reasons.By using third party APIs in your products or services, you have access to a ton of useful features — such as authentication or storage services — that can benefit both you and your users.By exposing your own API, your application becomes “part of the mix” and will be used in ways you’ve never thought before… if you do it the right way, obviously.In this two part series I’ll show you how to create a RESTful API layer for your PHP applications, using a collection of real world best practices.The full source code of this project will be available at the end of part 2.</p>
