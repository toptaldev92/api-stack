<p>Micro Service Architecture is an architectural concept that aims to decouple a solution by decomposing functionality into discrete services.Think of it as applying many of the principles of SOLID at an architectural level, instead of classes youve got services.Conceptually speaking MSA is not particularly difficult to grasp but in practice it does raise many questions.How do these services communicate?What about latency between services?</p>
