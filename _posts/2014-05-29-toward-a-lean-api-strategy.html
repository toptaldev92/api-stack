<p>“Lean”, “API” and “IoT” are probably the most hyped terms in our industry right now.Normally, I tend to blog about the latter two but – for a change – I would like to balance that out by talking about the former: the concept of Lean and how it relates APIs.You have probably heard about or even read The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.And you may have noticed that this book sparked a whole cottage industry of Lean publications, like Lean Analytics, Lean UX and the widely-misunderstood concept of “minimal viable product”.But few of you may have ventured back to explore the texts that laid the foundation for the Lean startup.</p>
