<p>In this webcast, API Design: Third Edition, our hosts drew upon the discussions and implementations with hundreds of crafters and technologists that have helped further shape their API design thinking in the 12 months since the previous edition of RESTful API Design.In this webcast: The New Three Tier Architecture: HTML5, Proxies &amp; APIs, @landlessness and @kevinswiber discussed the 3-tier architecture of presentation, logic and data and the technologies that underlay these tiers, which power the mobile web.Behind the logic and presentation layers, the data tier is traditionally driven by relational databases.Today, with rich APIs available for developers to store application data, a traditional RDB is often not used by modern apps.API facade is an important design pattern in an API designers toolbox and a powerful tool for app developers who need to work with APIs they dont control.</p>
