<p>At Defrag this week got together with Kin Lane at API Evangelist to talk about something we’d been working on together for a while – an initiative to try to encourage sharing and reuse of API Definitions.We’re greatful for all the feedback and coverage we received (see – Techcrunch, Forbes), Wired, ZDNET, Dr.Dobbs and elsewhere + also the Twitter and Event feedback.Some tweets summarized it best: #APICommons enables authors of interfaces to declare whats reusable in simple terms http://t.co/dKNELTZDWR @APICommons — SD Times (@sdtimes) November 8, 2013 and there were interesting discussion points and questions (see below).</p>
