<p>My conference session How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters has always drawn large crowds; on InfoQ was the third most viewed content last year.When I presented this session as an invited talk at OOPSLA 2006, I was given the opportunity to write an abstract for the proceedings.In place of an ordinary abstract I decided to try something a bit unusual: I distilled the essence of the talk down to a modest collection of pithy maxims, in the spirit of Jon Bentleys classic Bumper-Sticker Computer Science, Item 6 in his excellent book, More Programming Pearls: Confessions of a Coder (Addison-Wesley, 1988).It is my hope that these maxims provide a concise summary of the key points of API design, in easily digestible form: All programmers are API designers.Good programs are modular, and intermodular boundaries define APIs.</p>
