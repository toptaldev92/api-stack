<p>RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs.It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices.The goal is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems and then encourage ever-better API patterns.RAML is built on broadly-used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.For every API, start by defining which version of RAML you are using, and then document basic characteristics of your API - the title, version, and baseURI.</p>
