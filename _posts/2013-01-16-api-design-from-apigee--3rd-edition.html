<p>In this webcast, Brian Mulloy and Kevin Swiber drew upon the discussions and implementations with hundreds of crafters and technologists that have helped further shape their API design thinking in the 12 months since the previous edition of RESTful API Design.Â  Grounded in the premise that the design of an API communicates how it will be used by app developers - the customers of an API - Brian and Kevin explore the design principles and best practices you can employ to maximize developer productivity and ensure that app developers enjoy success using your API in their apps.</p>
