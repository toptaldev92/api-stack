<p>The United States’ White House has developed a set of API standards they are hoping will be used across all government agencies.The standards were developed following a number of API releases, including the White House’s We The People API that allows citizen petition collection and lodgement.The new API standards document naming conventions, minimum requirements, and best practices for RESTful interfaces, while also acknowledging the importance of offering a “positive developer experience” through their API releases.The standards have been published to github.White House staffers are hoping other government agencies will copy and personalise the standards to fit their API releases.</p>
