<p>Over a relatively short period of time the number of different APIs being created for use on the Web has grown at a sustained pace.In working on these interfaces, many in the community discuss the benefits of certain approaches over others and reach agreement as to the preferred solution when facing a given problem.Keeping track of all these gems is however difficult given the volume of work being carried on in parallel and the sometimes disjointed nature of the groups involved.As a result, it can take a long while and many arguments repeated almost identically before a good solution becomes common.Whats more, it is altogether too rare to garner feedback from developers who are actually using these features in their day-to-day work.</p>
