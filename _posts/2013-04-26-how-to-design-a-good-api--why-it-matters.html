<p>A well-written API can be a great asset to the organization that wrote it and to all that use it.Given the importance of good API design, surprisingly little has been written on the subject.In this talk (recorded at Javapolis), Java library designer Joshua Bloch teaches how to design good APIs, with many examples of what good and bad APIs look like.Joshua Bloch is a Principal Engineer at Google.He led the design and implementation of numerous Java platform features, including the Java Collections Framework.</p>
