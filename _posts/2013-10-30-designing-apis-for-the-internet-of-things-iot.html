<p>I’m looking forward to our next API Tech Talk for several reasons.First of all, on Oct 31 at 9am Pacific, we’ll be discussing some topics that are very hot in IT right now: the Internet of Things (IoT), API design and – more specifically – how to design APIs with IoT in mind.Secondly, Holger Reinhardt will be our special guest expert.Holger was a Product Architect at Layer 7 before the company’s acquisition by CA technologies and now he’s Senior Principal, Business Unit Strategy, an expert on IoT and Big Data and all-around great guy.I also happen to find the concept of IoT – all manner of devices and other “things” connected on the Internet – inherently fascinating.</p>
