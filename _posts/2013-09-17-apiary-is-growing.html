<p>This morning I’m happy to announce that Apiary has raised $1.63 million in seed funding from Baseline, Flybridge and other great investors.While I’ll leave the investment details to the PR wire, I wanted to take a moment to talk about what this means for us, and what it means for you—our users.Free as in Free Beer As part of our beta, we’ve offered our platform tools for free.Naturally, we’re often asked when we’re going to start charging and how much.</p>
