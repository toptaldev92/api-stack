<p>Some people asked me to explain what I meant by “releasing Zalgo” in async APIs, so I thought I’d share the following guidelines.Please follow all of these rules in your programs.If you deviate from them, you do so at the peril of your very sanity.Get Over Your Provincial Boilerplate Preferences Personally, I don’t actually care all that much about the whole promises/callbacks/coroutines/generators debate.It’s provably trivial to turn any callback-taking API into a promise-returning API or generator-yielding API or vice-versa.</p>
