<p>Proper HTTP response code usage is one of the most powerful yet underutilized aspects in web development.Most developers are familiar with the common 200 OK, the often-used 301 and 302 redirects, and the ever-annoying 404 Not Found but there are over 40 other codes that offer granularity and flexibility to API designers and their client applications.When we designed the Clarify API (formerly OP3Nvoice), we wanted to Do the Right Thing and take advantage of the HTTP response codes.More importantly, we wanted to make sure to use each in the correct context and for the right purposes.Towards that goal, here are the most common HTTP response codes you may see while using an API along with where you’ll see them in the Clarify API: 409 Conflict - This response code describes that the request was unable to be completed due to a request conflict.</p>
