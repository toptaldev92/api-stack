<p>The idea that good design is essential to building great products and services has become a truism in our industry.Most of us intuitively understand the idea that expending effort on the design of our code, system architecture and APIs will payoff after implementation.Iâ€™m certainly a big believer in the power of good design for the API space, but I wanted to explore a situation where a design focus might not be necessary.Consider the case of a small business offering a cloud-based service product for a niche market.If this business chose to invest in a well-designed, developer-centric API, at a minimum they could expect: A reduced learning curve for developers consuming the interface A reduction in troubleshooting time Increased interest from their developer community For most audiences, these are goals worth achieving.</p>
