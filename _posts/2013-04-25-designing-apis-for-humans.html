<p>Earlier this month I gave a talk at Devs Love Bacon on an API design philosophy I picked up while working at IFTTT I’ve been calling ‘APIs for Humans’.Sadly, it’s not about this: OH at @devslovebacon “I thought the “APIs for humans” talk was about controlling humans” #devslovebacon — Julian Cheal (@juliancheal) April 12, 2013 At IFTTT I identified three major areas for how non-developers end up consuming API data in significant numbers.In this talk I cover what those areas are and how you can tailor your API designs to encourage developers to build human-friendly integrations.Since I had extra time I threw in a few points on developer experience too.After all, developers are humans too.</p>
