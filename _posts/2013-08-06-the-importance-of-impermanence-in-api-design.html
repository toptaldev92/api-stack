<p>This guest post comes from Lorinda Brandon, Director of Solutions Strategy at SmartBear Software.You can follow her on Twitter or find her blogging regularly at SmartBear.At the API Craft un-conference this week in Detroit, some of the best minds in the API business gathered to talk over the problems that plague us most.It was a unique event in that the agenda was set and run by the attendees in true meet-up fashion.Quakers will recognize the format – for the conference kick-off, the group sits in silence until someone is moved to suggest a session.</p>
