<p>Tackling API development with an API first approach allows companies to focus on designing APIs to deliver business, rather than focusing on the nuts and bolts of implementing those APIs.With API first design, businesses can create an application programming interface optimized for adoption and once finalized, use a platform to rapidly implement it by connecting it to backend services.Moreover, teams can work on various elements of an API solution simultaneously, ensuring all that it meets your technical and business expectations.Starting with an API description is core to this API first approach â€“ a clearly written service description makes it much easier for team members to collaborate from the very beginning.API mocking enables your team to build tests, clients and the server implementation for your API in parallel.</p>
