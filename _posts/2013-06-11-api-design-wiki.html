<p>This website is online and up-to-date addition to the Practical API Design book, where the community interested in API Design can get together and share findings about the rules of proper API Design.Join us by reading TheAPIBook, talk to us via e-mail, blogs or wiki and enjoy exploring the world of good API Design.I have separated my blogs into three categories to match the categories of the TheAPIBook.I am trying to blog at least one a week and as far as can say, I am able to keep up with my own schedule.</p>
