<p>APIs are often described in JSON, and XML Schema or XML-based client tooling doesn’t work.  Swagger enables developers to describe the API message, produce API schema documentations, and simplify connecting clients to APIs.The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server.The documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync. WSO2 API Manager now integrates Swagger code.</p>
