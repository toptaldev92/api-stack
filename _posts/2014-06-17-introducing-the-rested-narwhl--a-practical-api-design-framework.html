<p>At Gluecon 2014, I introduced the RESTed NARWHL, the API design framework I developed based on best case practices to help development teams cut through the debates permeating the REST community and implement working API programs now.In this video, I describe the motivation behind developing NARWHL and highlights some of its features. For a more detailed description of NARWHL, visit the companion site at http://www.narwhl.com.</p>
