<p>Your API is only as good as its documentation.API Documentation is a must for any public API and a need for you private APIs.To have always valid documentation is a holy grail for any API owner.That is why Iâ€™m very excited to announce the release of the Dredd command-line test runner for API Blueprint.Write blueprints!</p>
