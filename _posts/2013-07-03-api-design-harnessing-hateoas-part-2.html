<p>In Part 1 of this discussion, we looked at questions people have in regard to HATEOAS.Now let’s examine how API crafters can revise their API so that it is truly RESTful.Because this is an introduction, we’ll avoid going into detail.Instead, we’ll assert the key point upfront: pure REST APIs require hypermedia clients.From the perspective of pure REST, if an API is HATEOAS compliant then the client app must also be HATEOAS compliant.</p>
