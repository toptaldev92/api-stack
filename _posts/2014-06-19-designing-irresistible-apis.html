<p>I spend a lot of time traveling around and teaching people how to make better APIs.The current focus of my talks is Designing Irresistible APIs – I’ll be giving this talk (or a version of it) at OSCON, and just presented it at Future Insights Live, as well as doing a webcast to get people excited about OSCON.Understand the business value of your API. Are you trying to drive usage, integrate with partners, attract new users, excite existing users? Your API is unlikely to directly drive revenue unless it’s your main product, so understand what you want to get out of your API before you even start creating it.</p>
