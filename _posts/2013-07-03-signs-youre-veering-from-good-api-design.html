<p>Every developer sets out to make their API perfect when they start writing it, but, at least from this authors experience, it often veers as requirements pour in.The following is a small checklist of things that might indicate youre veering too far.This is a common mistake made with web apps.People have a tendency to route everything, including non-safe operations, through a GET.Other than things like logging and writing to a cache, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE shouldn’t have any side effects on the data being requested, if they do then there’s probably another verb that describes the operation more closely.</p>
