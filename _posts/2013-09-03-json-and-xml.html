<p>After the Limit/Offset feature, the next most asked about thing we get is how to control whether you get JSON or XML back from our API.This question is actually pretty understandable because of the way this is controlled.Most of the search features in the APIs are controlled via parameters passed in either with the query string portion of the URL, or as part of a block of text passed to the API via a HTTP POST.The Infoconnect API, and indeed many RESTful APIs, uses HTTP headers to communicate what the format of the data is coming in and going out.HTTP headers, for those who donâ€™t know, are basically a collection of key/value pair text parameters that make up part of the underlying HTTP communication between a client and server.</p>
