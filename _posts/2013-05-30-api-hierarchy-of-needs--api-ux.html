<p>The API hierarchy of needs is inspired by the work of Abraham Maslow, a psychologist who created a theory that explains how human needs are fulfilled — the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.API Hierarchy of Needs While Maslow’s goal was to understand and explain the priorities of human needs, from breathing and feeding to self-esteem and morality, the API hierarchy of needs explains different characteristics that make an API usable.The hierarchy of needs is a pyramid divided into five different layers that represent different characteristics that you should consider when launching and maintaining an API.Usability Usability is at the bottom of the pyramid because it’s the most important characteristic that will dictate the success of your API among developers.Is your API easy to set up and use by developers?</p>
