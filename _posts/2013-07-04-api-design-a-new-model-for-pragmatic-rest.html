<p>In our last post, we talked about pure REST and HATEOAS.In this post, well propose some ideas to initiate the creation of a new API design model based on pragmatic REST.We need to create an intellectual framework for API design that captures the spirit of how most popular web APIs are designed today.Lets start our discussion with a very specific question about including links in API responses.If you arenâ€™t going down the path of HATEOAS, should you include links in API responses?</p>
