<p>February 28, 2014, 8:00 AM â€” The least exciting part of any software project I work on is the documentation.With APIs in particular, documentation can be time consuming because it needs to provide enough detail for any consumer to understand and interface with it.For that reason, proper documentation of an API is even more crucial.The most recent two projects Ive been working on both required that full APIs be developed in addition to the core of the platform.On one of them I was building both the API and the client to consume it so the need to describe the API was nil.</p>
