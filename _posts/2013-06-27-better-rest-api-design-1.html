<p>Basically, think about the future, if any version update, the v1 url can still keep working at the same time so it wont break old customers.2.Use meaningful resource name use the noun instead of verb, bad examples: addOrder deleteOrder registerUser getOrderLines This is old SOAP way of doing it, the impact is one resource will end up in many endpoints, in the long term messed the api.Rest is working on the resources, resources are usually nouns, for example, order user Response Body: Â Successful requests contain the requested entity resource representation, while failed requests show an error representation.Example: Requests that contain body content must specify the HTTP Content-Type header with a value of application/json.</p>
