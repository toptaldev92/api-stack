<p>On Monday, July 15, were going to have an informational meeting to describe a new activity - ADLs next big thing following on from the effort that went into creating the Experience API - which is focused on people working together in shared, practical experiences designing, developing and managing efforts that make use of xAPI.Its going to be a team-based, DIY approach, and its based on what we learn from doing this that will inform an ADL Profile of the Experience API.For more info, I highly encourage you to read the blog post “Aaron Silvers: xAPI Design is Our Next Big Thing” with a few more details including a nice nugget with firm details for our first xAPI Plugfest.  This is going to be big, and its going to realize the potential inherent in all the work that our specification effort has prepared us for, as a community and as an industry.Please freely reach out to me with any questions.</p>
