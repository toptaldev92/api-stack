<p>These days, technology leaders are asked to do more and move faster.But they usually aren’t given any more budget to meet the demands of a fast evolving, agile, responsive enterprise.Winning in today’s environment requires more intelligent ways to achieve our goals; this, in turn, requires finding ways to remove unnecessary spend from our budgets, and freeing more dollars for innovation.  We need to rationalize our spending in a rational way.  Our new eBook APIs and IT Rationalization discusses two main aspects of IT rationalization: cost avoidance (not paying for something you would have otherwise had to pay for) and cost savings (reducing or eliminating a current payment); we explore the less-obvious categories for these new efficiencies, including operational, regulatory and compliance, development, and process.</p>
