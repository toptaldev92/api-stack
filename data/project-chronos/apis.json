Thousands of rovers and micro-probes will be surfing the System, controlled by many private and public institutions and, eventually, by private citizens, with the goal of collecting and sharing data. Space is too vast to have restricted access: cheap technologies (micro-satellites, social participation, open challenges, private launchers), multidisciplinarity, and always more specialized knowledge are taking part to the race.&nbsp;",
