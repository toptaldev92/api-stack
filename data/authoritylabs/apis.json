We offer the ability to graph related keywords, create user accounts to give other access, export account data and get dashboard reports delivered to an email account on a weekly basis. We&rsquo;re founded by Chase Granberry with backing by the local early-stage startup fund Gangplank (http://gangplankhq.com). After two months of private beta AuthorityLabs launched with paying customers and continues to gain customers on a daily basis.",
