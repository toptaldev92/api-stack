			"description": "Filepicker.io is a tool that allows users to access and upload their content to the cloud both from their local machines as well as online. Developers can use the API to integrate access to cloud servcies within their applications. The Javascript API gives developers the ability to customize the user experience for both choosing and saving files. The Pick files functionality allows users to make their upload forms handle local uploads as well as uploads from services such as Dropbox and Facebook and devices such as webcams. The Save files functionality allows users to save content directly to Dropbox, Google drive, Evernote, or even as an email attachment, rather than downloading it to their local device. The API uses JavaScript protocol. A RESTful interface is available for working with Filepicker.io URLs.",
