We get Google alerts every time someone types our name on the web, but not every time someone says our name. Pop Up Archive helps solve this problem by making spoken word searchable. Using speech-to-text software built for specific industries, we enable media companies and institutions like NPR, KQED, Princeton, Stanford to find, reuse, and monetize media. Rich media search provides accessibility, search engine optimization, and advertising opportunities.",
