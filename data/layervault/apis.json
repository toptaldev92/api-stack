Design files can be synced across devices through LayerVault&#039;s sync service or via Dropbox. Designers can also request and exchange feedback on design changes with team members. When a project is complete, designers can put together a clutter-free presentation with their own branding and share it easily. The LayerVault API allows developers to integrate information stored with LayerVault into other applications via REST calls.",
