	"description": "Orchestrate provides a simple RESTful API service that eliminates the need for developers to operate their own databases in production. Powered by best-of-breed NoSQL databases, it unifies full-text search, social graph, activity feed, key/value document and time-ordered event queries in a single interface, eliminating the operational and financial burden of deploying databases when both building new applications and adding new features to existing ones. Behind the scenes, Orchestrate handles the complex task of building, operating, and scaling a high performance, fault tolerant data layer.",
