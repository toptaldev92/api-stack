And the vision for Giphy isn&rsquo;t really just about finding GIFs. It&rsquo;s a search engine today but soon you&rsquo;ll see it grow into a community, a platform with a host of features targeted at gif artists, enthusiasts, bloggers, and anyone generally looking to discover or create that next big meme.",
