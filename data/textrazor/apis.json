It applies machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to connect a text sample with a knowledge base and identify known elements and their relationships.\n\nAPI methods support submission of a text sample to be parsed. Methods identify text strings associated with known named entities and detail the relationships and dependencies between them by type. Methods also identify synonyms for identified terms and topics or themes referenced in the text sample.",
