	"description": "Foursquare is a geographical location based social network that incorporates gaming elements. Users share their location with friends by &ldquo;checking in&rdquo; via a smartphone app or by text message. Points are awarded for checking in at various venues. Users can connect their Foursquare accounts to their Twitter and Facebook accounts, which can update when a check in is registered. By checking in a certain number of times, or in different locations, users can collect virtual badges. In addition, users who have checked in the most times at a certain venue will be crowned &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; until someone surpasses their number. Various venues have embraced Foursquare, and offer special deals to users who are &ldquo;mayors&rdquo;.",
