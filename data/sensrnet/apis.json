We keep the images around and organize them by time and day. Well send you an email or a text message if youd like when we detect something. Heading out of town for the weekend? Leave your camera pointed at the front door. If someone comes in, well text you. You can also share your cameras with your friends or the whole world. We encourage sharing, but its best not to share cameras located in ultra private spaces. Sorry, we dont allow adult content on our site. There are plenty of other places on the Internet if youre looking for that kind of stuff.",
