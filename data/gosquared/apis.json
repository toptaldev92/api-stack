	"description": "GoSquared helps you understand and improve your online presence. GoSquared creates two web applications for monitoring your website&rsquo;s traffic in real-time - Dashboard and Trends. Dashboard is a real-time traffic monitoring app that gives you an overview of your website&rsquo;s traffic right now - in a single glance. It lets you see which pages of your site are most popular, where your visitors are coming from, and info on every visitor currently browsing your website along with how they&rsquo;re browsing (what browser, operating system, screen size, etc.), which language they&rsquo;re speaking, and what city they&rsquo;re from. Dashboard doesn&rsquo;t just tell you who&rsquo;s on your site, it also knows what page they&rsquo;re on, and what pages they&rsquo;ve been on. It know&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ve come from (Twitter, Digg, Google, etc.) making it easy to see when someone&rsquo;s talking about you. Trends takes all the data in Dashboard and builds beautiful, easy to read charts and tables so that you can analyse how your website has been performing over the past day, week, month, or year. Trends enables you to gain insights into your website&rsquo;s traffic data quicker than ever before - without having to click a single button.",
