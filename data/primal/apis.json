		"description": "Primal is a cloud-based data service (DaaS) that filters and organizes Web content based on the interests of individual end users. Primal&#039;s RESTful API allows developers create expansive semantic networks representing the interests of end-users. These interest networks can be used to personalize your products and services. The service can connect to any publicly accessible sources of content on the Web, delivering information that&#039;s precisely filtered according to the interests of your end-users. Each call to the API is formated as a simple URL that describes a topic. The data response presents a hierarchy of related topics that describe the interest to a high level of fidelity. The data response also includes content abstracts that are tagged with the topics of interest. Primal&#039;s underlying AI includes a learning mechanism that acquires and refines this interest data over time, making the ongoing operation and maintenance of the data seamless and painless.",
