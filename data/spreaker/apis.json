Spreaker gives its users the chance to take part in a rich community of audio creators broadcasting thousands of shows, tracks, and playlists: they can listen to rising talents, or upload their own creations to share easily with blogs, sites, and social networks.

And it is possible to broadcast live streams or just record sounds.",
