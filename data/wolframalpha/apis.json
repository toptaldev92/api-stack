Its language interface will accommodate variations in how users frame their questions, such as the use of abbreviations. Wolfram Alpha&rsquo;s vision is to create a system which can do for formal knowledge (heuristics, algorithms, rules, methods, theorems, etc.) what search engines like Google have done for informal knowledge, such as text and documents.</p>",
