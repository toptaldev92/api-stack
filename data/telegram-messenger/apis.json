	"description": "Telegram is about freedom and openness &ndash; our code is open for everyone, as is our API. Today we&rsquo;re making another step towards openness by launching a Bot API and platform for third-party developers to create bots. Bots are simply Telegram accounts operated by software &ndash; not people &ndash; and theyll often have AI features. They can do anything &ndash; teach, play, search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things.",
