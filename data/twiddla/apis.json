	"description": "<p>Twiddla is a web-based service that helps distributed teams meet virtually and collaborate in real time by providing tools to create mark-ups of live Web sites, uploaded images and documents, or a blank canvas. In addition to an advanced chat feature, Twiddla offers an opportunity for collaborators to speak with one another via PhoneFromHere.com. It involves no plug-ins or downloads, no Flash, no need to work around complex firewalls, no advanced scheduling. It&rsquo;s available 24-7 and the only requirement is a computer with an internet connection and a web browser. It&rsquo;s browser-agnostic and free. You don&rsquo;t even have to sign up to start using the service.</p>",
