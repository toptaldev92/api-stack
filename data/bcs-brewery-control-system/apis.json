	"description": "The BCS, or Brewery Control System, was originally designed as an interactive temperature controller for small to medium size breweries. The BCS series controllers have gained wide popularity with homebrewing, winemaking, and mead making applications. They are also used as a general purpose industrial controller due to their inherent flexibility. The BCS monitors temperature sensors and discrete inputs (switches), and controls outputs (relays) which in turn open or close valves, switch heating elements, or control other devices.",
