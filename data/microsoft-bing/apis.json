		"description": "Bing API Version 2.0 enables you to embed a flexible and powerful search engine as a custom search component in your sites and applications. The Microsoft Bing API offers open, flexible options for building or enhancing your site or applications. Developing an application with the new API is straightforward: Choose a SourceTypes (Web, Images, InstantAnswer, Phonebook, RelatedSearch, Spelling), choose an output protocol (JSON, SOAP, or XML) and then customize according to your needs. Both the HTTP endpoints and the OpenSearch RSS interface are new in this version. With the addition of these interfaces and enhanced SOAP support, you are now able to choose the style of access and presentation most appropriate for your application.",
