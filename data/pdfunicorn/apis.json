The markup language is intentionally simple to allow you to start creating templates and documents as quickly and easily as possible. Document content is securely sent from your server to ours enabling private customer text and images to be included without allowing remote access to your server and content. Document images can be uploaded at print quality resolutions to create the best looking documents possible.</p>",
