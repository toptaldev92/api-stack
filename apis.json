	"description": "The API Stack is an interactive, published list of companies that I'm watching in the API space. I regularly go through my list of companies in my CRM and high grade them, and promote or demote them on my monitoring list. The API Stack is meant to be a reflection of this research, published in a way that others can browse, and fork.",
