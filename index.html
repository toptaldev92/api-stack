title: The API Stack
---
<p>I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and this is <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a>. Here you will find all of the companies, organizations, and government agencies I track on as part of my API monitoring. My goal is to not just have a directory of APIs, but a machine readable index of the best APIs out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the API Stack, I am focusing on generating <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> indexes of APIs that are defined using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">OADF files</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. You can access <a href="http://theapistack.com/apis.json">a single APIs.json for this site</a>, and then spider a list of APIs.json entries for each company, which will then give you links to each API, any supporting Swagger, API Blueprint, and other building blocks of each API's operations.</p>
<p>You can browse this site <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html">by business sector (loose tags)</a>, or see <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">a complete list of companies</a>, and their APIs. Each company present <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">has a folder in the gh-pages branch data folder</a>, and each company has an APIs.json, Swagger, or potentially API Blueprint file (coming soon). If there is a company missing, that you think should be in the stack, submit a pull request and add to the folder, and master APIs.json. If there is a Swagger file, or API Blueprint file that is incomplete or missing, submit a pull request with the changes you want to see.</p>
<p>I will be working to evolve this definition, and establish services and tooling to help validate and certify APIs.json, OADF, and API Blueprint files. All work is conducted via <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">this Github repository</a>, with the conversation around work conducted for each company, possessing its own Github Issue. <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/issues">All other support for this project will be done through the project's Github issues</a>, and regular Github workflow.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved as a partner, let me know. We need as many people contributing to, and working from a common set of complete API definitions, that represent the entire API ecosystem--then we'll start seeing some benefits emerge that help strengthen the entire API economy.</p>
