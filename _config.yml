support_title: Support My API Stack Research
support_header: I depend on the support of my partners to fund my work as an independent analysts. I have been monitoring the world of APIs since July of 2010 through the support of my partners, and a handful of writing or consulting projects along the way. If you find what I do valuable, please help support me by purchasing my guides, giving below, or if you are need of API definitions created for specific 3rd party, or your own APIs, let me know..
support_footer: I pay my bills by consulting on API projects, and writing white papers and guides. You can find much of my research freely available across my website(s). Anyone who gives $250.00 or more a month, will automatically get access to all of my content via a shared Dropbox, Google Drive, or Github repository. Thank you for your support, and feel free to ping me directly if you have more questions.
